            assignment of resources to intentional categories, is the focus of this chapter. In
                <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a>, we described categories as cognitive and linguistic
            models for applying prior knowledge and we discussed a set of principles for creating
            categories and category systems. We explained how cultural categories serve as the
            foundations upon which individual and institutional categories are based. Institutional
            categories are most often created in abstract and information-intensive domains where
            unambiguous and precise categories enable <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_classification"><em class="glossterm">classification</em></a> to be purposeful and
            principled.</p><p><a id="id641433" class="indexterm"/><a id="id641451" class="indexterm"/><a id="id641461" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_classifications"/>A system of categories and its attendant
                rules or access methods are typically called a <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_classification_scheme"><em class="glossterm">classification scheme</em></a></strong></span> or just the <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_classifications"><em class="glossterm">classifications</em></a></strong></span>. A system
                of categories captures the distinctions and relationships among its resources that
                are most important in a domain and for a particular context of use, creating a
                reference model or conceptual roadmap for its users.</span> This classification
            creates the structure and support for the interactions that human or computational
            agents perform. For example, research libraries and bookstores do not use the same
            classifications to organize books, but the categories they each use are appropriate for
            their contrasting types of collections and the different kinds of browsing and searching
            activities that take place in each context. Likewise, the scientific classifications for
            animals used by biologists contrast with those used in pet stores because the latter
            have no need for the precise differentiation enabled by the former.</p><p>Most of the chapter is a survey of topics that span the broad range of how
            classifications are used in organizing systems. These include enumerative
            classification, faceted classification, activity-based classification, and computational
            classification. Because classification and standardization are closely related, we also
            analyze standards and standards making as they apply to organizing systems. Throughout,
            we observe how personal, institutional, cultural, linguistic, political, religious and
            even artistic biases can affect otherwise principled and purposeful classification
            schemes.</p><div class="sect2" title="Classification vs. Categorization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-7.1.1">Classification vs. Categorization</h3></div></div></div><p>Classification requires a system of categories, so not everyone distinguishes
                classification from categorization. Batley, for example, says classification is
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">imposing some sort of structure on our understanding of our
                    environment,</span>”</span> a vague definition that applies equally well to
                    categorization.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-01" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-01" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">376</a>]</sup></p><p>In the discipline of organizing, the definition of classification is narrower and
                more formal. The contrasts among cultural, individual, and institutional categories
                in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.2" title="The What and Why of Categories">The What and Why of Categories</a> yield a precise definition of <span class="strong"><strong>classification: <span><a id="def_classification"/>The systematic

                intentionality behind the system of categories, the systematic processes for using
                them, and implies the greater requirements for <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_governance"><em class="glossterm">governance</em></a> and <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_maintaining"><em class="glossterm">maintenance</em></a> that are absent for cultural categories and most

                collection of resources are used in a principled and systematic manner. This method
                of classification is essential to satisfy institutional and commercial purposes.
                However, this degree of rigor might be excessive for personal classifications and
                for classifications of resources in social or informal contexts.</p><p>Instead, a weaker approach to organizing resources is to use any property of a
                resource and any vocabulary to describe it, regardless of how well it differentiates
                it from other resources to create a system of categories. This method of organizing
                resources is most often called <span class="strong"><strong>tagging</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.2.2.3" title="Tagging of Web-Based Resources">Tagging of Web-Based Resources</a>), but it has also been called

                it serves goals to convey information, develop a community, or manage reputation.
                Regardless of its name, however, tagging is popular for organizing and rating
                photos, websites, email messages, or other web-based resources or web-based
                descriptions of physical resources like stores and restaurants.</p><p><a id="id641712" class="indexterm"/>The distinction between classification and tagging was blurred when <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Thomas</span> <span class="surname">Vander Wal</span></span> coined the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">folksonomy</span>”</span> <span class="symbol">—</span>combining <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">folk</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">taxonomy</span>”</span>

                throughout the site determines the size of the text in the tag cloud. The tag cloud
                emerges through the bottom-up aggregation of user tags and is a statistical
                construct, rather than a semantic one.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-04" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-04" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">379</a>]</sup></p><p>Tagging seems insufficiently principled to be considered classification. Tagging a
                photo as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">red</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">car</span>”</span> is an act of resource description,
                not classification, because the other tags that would serve as the alternative
                classifications are unspecified. Furthermore, when tagging principles are followed
                at all, they are likely to be idiosyncratic ones that were not pre-determined or
                arrived at through an analysis of goals and requirements.</p><p>Noticeably, some uses of tags treat them as category labels, turning tagging into
                classification. Many websites and resources encourage users to assign
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Like</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">+1</span>”</span> tags to them, and because these tags
                are pre-defined, they are category choices in an implied classification system; for
                example, we can consider <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Like</span>”</span> as an alternative to a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Not liked
                    enough</span>”</span> category.</p><p><a id="id641899" class="indexterm"/>When users or communities establish sets of principles to govern their tagging
                practices, tagging is even more like classification. Such a tagging system can be
                called a <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_tagsonomy"><em class="glossterm">tagsonomy</em></a></strong></span>, a neologism we have
                invented to describe more systematic tagging. For example, a tagsonomy could
                predetermine tags as categories to be assigned to particular contents of a blog
                post, or specify the level of abstraction and granularity for assigning tags without
                predetermining them (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.4" title="Category Design Issues and Implications">Category Design Issues and Implications</a>). Some people use multiple user
                accounts for the same application to establish distinct personas or contexts (e.g.,
                personal vs. business photo collections) as a way to make their tagsonomies more
                distinct.</p><p>Making these decisions about tagging content and form and applying them in the
                tagging process transforms an <span xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase"><em xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span> set
                of tags into a principled tagsonomy. When tagging is introduced in a business
                setting, more pragmatic purposes and more systematic tagging<span class="symbol">—</span>for example, 
                by using tags from lists of departments or
                products<span class="symbol">—</span>also tends to create tagsonomic
                    classification.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-05" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-05" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">380</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Classification vs. Physical Arrangement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-7.1.3">Classification vs. Physical Arrangement</h3></div></div></div><p>We have often stressed the principle in the discipline of organizing that logical
                issues must be separated from implementation issues (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.2.3.1" title="The Concept of “Organizing Principle”">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Organizing Principle</span>”</span></a>, <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.5" title="Designing the Description Form">Designing the Description Form</a>, and <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#section-5.7" title="The Implementation Perspective">The Implementation Perspective </a>). With classification we separate the conceptual act of
                assigning a resource to a category from the subsequent but often incidental act of
                putting it in some physical or digital storage location. This focus on the logical
                essence of classification is elegantly expressed in a definition by Gruenberg:
                        <span><span class="bold"><strong>Classification</strong></span> is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">a higher
                        order thinking skill requiring the fusion of the naturalist’s eye for
                        relationships...with the logician’s desire for structured order...the
                        mathematician’s compulsion to achieve consistent, predictable results...and
                        the linguist’s interest in explicit and tacit expressions of
                        meaning.</span>”</span></span><sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-06" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-06" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">381</a>]</sup></p><p>Taking a conceptual or cognitive perspective on classification contrasts with much
                conventional usage in library science, where classification is mostly associated
                with arranging tangible items on shelves, emphasizing the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">parking</span>”</span>
                function that realizes the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">marking</span>”</span> function of identifying the
                category to which the resource belongs.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-07" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-07" class="footnote">382</a>]</sup></p><p>From a library science or collection curation perspective, it seems undeniable
                that when the resources being classified are physical or tangible things such as
                books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots, the end result of the classification
                activity is that some resource has been placed in some physical location. Moreover,
                the placement of physical resources can be influenced by the physical context in
                which they are organized. Once placed, the physical context often embodies some
                aspects of the organization when similar or related resources are arranged in nearby
                locations. In libraries and bookstores, this adjacency facilitates the serendipitous
                discovery of resources, as anyone well knows who has found an interesting book by
                browsing the shelves.</p><p><a id="id642147" class="indexterm"/>It might seem natural to identify storage locations with the classes
                used by the classification system. Just as we might think of a location in the zoo
                as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">lion habitat,</span>”</span> we can put a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">QC</span>”</span> sign on a
                particular row of shelves in a library where books about physics are
                arranged.</p><p>However, once we broaden the scope of organizing to include digital resources, it
                is clear that we rely on their logical classifications when we interact with them,
                not whether they reside on a computer in Berkeley or Bangalore. It is better to
                emphasize that a classification system is foremost a specification for the logical
                arrangement of resources because there are usually many possible and often arbitrary
                mappings of logical references to physical locations.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Classification Schemes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-7.1.4">Classification Schemes</h3></div></div></div><p>A classification scheme is a realization of one or more organizing principles.
                Physical resources are often classified according to their tangible or perceivable
                properties. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3.2" title="Single Properties">Single Properties</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3.3" title="Multiple Properties">Multiple Properties</a>, when properties take on only a small set of discrete
                values, a classification system naturally emerges in which each category is defined
                by one property value or some particular combination of property values. <a id="id642252" class="indexterm"/><a id="id642228" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_enumerative_classification"/>Classification schemes in
                    which all possible categories to which resources can be assigned are defined
                    explicitly are <span class="strong"><strong>enumerative</strong></span>.</span> For
                example, the enumerative classification for a personal collection of music recorded
                on <span class="hardware">physical media</span> might have categories for
                    <span class="hardware">CDs</span>, <span class="hardware">DVDs</span>, <span class="hardware">vinyl
                    albums</span>, <span class="hardware">8-track cartridges</span>,
                    <span class="hardware">reel-to-reel tape</span> and <span class="hardware">tape cassettes</span>;
                every music resource fits into one and only one of these categories.</p><p><a id="id642311" class="indexterm"/><a id="id642322" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_hierarchical_classification"/>When multiple resource
                    properties are considered in a fixed sequence, each property creates another
                    level in the system of categories and the classification scheme is <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" id="term_hierarchical_classification" href="go01.html#gloss_hierarchical_classification"><em class="glossterm">hierarchical</em></a></strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>taxonomic</strong></span>.</span> (See <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#section-5.3.1.1" title="Inclusion">Inclusion</a>.)

                    <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3.3.1" title="Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories">Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories</a> we described a hierarchical scheme for
                organizing <span class="hardware">shirts in a clothes closet</span> that arranges the shirts
                by style, and then by sleeve length, and finally by color; an example of the
                fine-grained categories at the lowest level in this classification is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white
                    long-sleeved dress shirts.</span>”</span></p><p><a id="id642381" class="indexterm"/>For information resources, their <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">aboutness</span>”</span> is usually
                more important than their physical properties. For example, a
                    <span class="hardware">professor</span>
                <span class="action">planning a new course</span> might <span class="action">organize candidate
                    articles</span> for the syllabus in a fixed set of categories, one for each
                potential lecture topic. It can be challenging to <span class="action">enumerate</span> all the
                subjects or topics that a collection of resources might be about. The <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Library of Congress Classification</span>(LCC)</span> is a hierarchical and enumerative scheme with a very detailed set of
                subject categories because books can be about almost anything. We discuss the

                are sometimes organized using intrinsic properties like author names or creation
                dates. Our professor might primarily organize his collection of articles by author
                name, and when he plans a new course, he might put those he selects for the syllabus
                into a classification system with one category for every scheduled lecture.</p><p><a id="id642435" class="indexterm"/><a id="id642446" class="indexterm"/><a id="id642462" class="indexterm"/><a id="id642468" class="indexterm"/><a id="id642472" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_implicit_classification"/>Because names and dates can
                    take on a great many values, an organizing principle like <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_alphabetical"><em class="glossterm">alphabetical</em></a> or <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_chronological"><em class="glossterm">chronological</em></a> ordering is unlikely
                    to enumerate in advance an explicit category for each possible value. Instead,
                    we can consider these organizing principles as creating an <span class="strong"><strong>implicit or latent</strong></span> classification system in which
                    the categories are generated only as needed. For example, the Q category only
                    exists in an alphabetical scheme if there is a resource whose name starts with
                    Q.</span></p><p>Many resource domains have multiple properties that might be used to define a
                classification scheme. For example, <span class="hardware">wine</span> can be classified by
                type of <span class="hardware">grape</span> (varietal), color, flavor, price, winemaker,
                region of origin (appellation), blending style, and other properties. Furthermore,
                people differ in their knowledge or preferences about these properties; some people

            a classification will be unbiased or satisfy all users’ requirements. For example, the

            overlay different parts of a city determine the present and future allocation of
            services and resources, and over time influence whether the city thrives or decays.
            These classifications reflect tradeoffs and negotiations among numerous participants,

                doing so differentiates among them. However, bringing resources together would be

                including enumeration, single properties, multiple properties and hierarchy, family
                resemblance, similarity, theory and goal-based categorization. It logically follows
                that the principles considered in designing categories are embodied in
                classifications that use those categories. However, when we say,
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">classification is principled,</span>”</span> we are going further to say that
                the processes of assigning resources to categories and maintaining the
                classification scheme over time must also follow principles.</p><p>The design and use of a classification system involves many choices about its
                purposes, scope, scale, intended lifetime, extensibility, and other considerations.
                Principled classification means that once those design choices are made they should
                be systematically and consistently followed.</p><p><a id="id644768" class="indexterm"/> Principled does not necessarily equate to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">good,</span>”</span> because
                many of the choices can be arbitrary and others may involve tradeoffs that depend on
                the nature of the resources, the purposes of the classification, the amount of
                effort available, and the capabilities of the people doing the classification and of
                the people using it (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.4" title="Category Design Issues and Implications">Category Design Issues and Implications</a>). Every classification system
                is biased in one way or another (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.3" title="Bibliographic Classification">Bibliographic Classification</a>).</p><p>Consider the classifications of resources in a highly-organized kitchen. Tableware
                (forks, spoons and cutlery) is usually kept together in a single drawer, separated
                by utensil type with a flatware organizer. Dishes are stacked on a cabinet shelf.
                Pots and pans are nested to save space, spices are alphabetized in a spice rack,
                items used for baking are on the same shelf, and coffee is next to the coffee maker.
                Items used frequently may be in more accessible areas<span class="symbol">—</span>on top
                in drawers, lower cabinets, and shelves<span class="symbol">—</span>than items used
                infrequently, which end up on high shelves or pushed to the back of cabinets. This
                classification system is not documented with a written specification and the person
                who created and uses it did not study principles of kitchen classification in
                school, but when she cleans up the kitchen after making a meal, everything goes back
                where it came from, making it easy to find necessary resources the next time she
                cooks. Other people might have different classifications of kitchen resources, and
                some people might use much simpler classification schemes because they do not cook
                often and do not mind rummaging around to find what they need when they do.</p><p>On the other hand, complex institutional classification systems like those used in
                libraries or government agencies are implemented with detailed specifications,
                methods, and guidelines. The people who apply them probably did study them in school
                or received extensive on-the-job training to ensure they apply them correctly and
                consistently.</p><div class="sect3" title="Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-7.2.2.1">Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme</h4></div></div></div><p>Some of the most important principles that lead us to say that classification

                    the first place. These principles are fundamental in the discipline of library

                    used.</span></p><p>A second principle embodied in a classification scheme concerns the breadth
                    and depth of the category hierarchy. We discussed this in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.4" title="Category Design Issues and Implications">Category Design Issues and Implications</a> but in the context of classification this principle
                    has additional implications and is framed as the extent to which the scheme is
                        <span class="strong"><strong>enumerative</strong></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.1.3" title="Classification vs. Physical Arrangement">Classification vs. Physical Arrangement</a>). The decision to classify broadly or precisely
                    depends largely on the variety or heterogeneity of the resources that the system
                    of categories has been designed to organize. Because of the diversity of
                    resources for a sale in a department store, a broad classification is necessary
                    to accommodate everything in the store. Kitchen goods will be grouped together
                    in a few aisles on a single floor. But a specialty kitchen store or a wholesale
                    kitchen supply store for restaurants would classify much more precisely because
                    of the restricted resource domain and the greater expertise of those who want to
                    buy things there. An entire section might be dedicated just to knives, organized
                    by knife type, manufacturer, quality of steel, and other categories that are not
                    used in the kitchen section of the department store.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-25" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-25" class="footnote">400</a>]</sup></p><p>The precision or enumerativeness of a classification scheme increases the
                    similarity of resources that are assigned to the same category and sharpens the
                    distinctions between resources in different categories. However, when different
                    classifications must be combined, mismatches in their precision or granularity
                    can create challenges (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#section-9.3" title="Organizing Resources for Interactions">Organizing Resources for Interactions</a>).</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-7.2.2.2">Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="id645310" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645321" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_uniqueness_principle"/>The <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" id="term_uniqueness_principle" href="go01.html#gloss_uniqueness_principle"><em class="glossterm">uniqueness

                        classification scheme are mutually exclusive. Thus, when a logical concept
                        is assigned to a particular category, it cannot simultaneously be assigned
                        to another category.</span> Resources, however, can be assigned several
                    categories if they embody several concepts represented by those different
                    categories. This can present a challenge when a physical storage solution is
                    based on storing resources according to its assigned category in a logical
                    classification system. This is not a serious problem for resource types like
                    technical equipment or tools, for which the properties used to classify them are
                    highly salient, and that have very narrow and predictable contexts of use. It is
                    also not a problem for highly-specialized information resources like scientific
                    research reports or government economic data, which might end up in only one
                    specialized class. However, many resources are inherently more difficult to
                    classify because they have less salient properties or because they have many
                    more possible uses.</p><p>We face this kind of problem all the time. For example, should we store a pair
                    of scissors in the kitchen or in the office? One solution is to buy a second
                    pair of scissors so that scissors can be kept in both locations where they are
                    typically used, but this is not practical for many types of resources and this
                    principle would be difficult to apply in a systematic manner.</p><p>Many books are about multiple subjects. A self-help book about coping with
                    change in a business setting might reasonably be classified as either about
                    applied psychology or about business. It is not helpful that book titles are
                    often poor clues to their content; <em class="citetitle">Who Moved My Cheese?</em>
                    is in fact a self-help book about coping with change in a business setting. Its <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Library of Congress Classification</span></span> is BF 637, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Applied Psychology,</span>”</span> and at UC Berkeley
                    it is kept in the business school library.</p><p>The general solution to satisfying the <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_uniqueness_principle"><em class="glossterm">uniqueness principle</em></a> in
                    library classifications when resources do not clearly fit in a single category
                    is to invent and follow a detailed set of often arbitrary rules. Usually, the
                    primary subject of the book is used for assigning a category, which will then
                    determine the book’s place on a shelf. However, a rule might also state that if
                    a book treats two subjects equally, the subject that is covered first determines
                    the classification. For some classifications a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">table of
                        preference</span>”</span> can trump other rules at the last minute. Not
                    surprisingly, the rules for categorizing books take a long time to learn and are
                    not always easy to apply.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-26" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-26" class="footnote">401</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-7.2.2.3">Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time</h4></div></div></div><p>The classification schemes in your kitchen or closet are deconstructed and
                    disappear when you move and take your possessions to a different house or
                    apartment. Your efforts to re-implement the classifications will be influenced
                    by the configuration of shelves and cabinets in your new residence, so they will
                    not be exactly the same. Most personal classifications are created in response
                    to a specific situation to solve an emerging organizational challenge. As a
                    consequence, personal classification systems change in an <span xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase"><em xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span> or opportunistic manner during their
                    limited lifetimes.</p><p><a id="id645436" class="indexterm"/>In contrast, the institutional classification schemes for many library
                    resources, culturally or scientifically-important artifacts, and much of the
                    information created or collected by businesses, governments and researchers
                    might have useful lives of decades or centuries. Classification systems like
                    these can only be changed incrementally to avoid disruption of the work flows of
                    the organization. We described maintaining resources as an activity in all
                    organizing systems (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.5" title="Maintaining Resources">Maintaining Resources</a>) and the issues of
                    persistence, effectivity, authenticity, and provenance that emerge with
                    resources over time (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.5" title="Resources over Time">Resources over Time</a>). Much of this previous
                    discussion applies in a straightforward manner to maintaining classifications
                    over time.</p><p>However, some additional issues arise with classifications over time. The most
                    important one is that the meaning of an underlying category can change, along
                    with its relative and absolute importance with respect to the other categories
                    in the classification system. Categories sometimes change slowly, but they can
                    also change quickly and radically as a result of technological, process, or
                    geopolitical innovation or events. Entirely new types of resources and bodies of
                    knowledge can appear in a short time. Consider what the categories of
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">travel,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">entertainment,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">computing,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">communication</span>”</span> mean today compared
                    to just a decade or two ago.</p><p><span><a id="def_integrity"/>Changes in the meaning of the categories in a
                        classification threaten its <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" id="term_integrity" href="go01.html#gloss_integrity"><em class="glossterm">integrity</em></a></strong></span>, the principle that categories should
                        not move within the structure of the classification
                        system.</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-27" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-27" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">402</a>]</sup> One way to maintain integrity while adapting to the dynamic and
                    changing nature of knowledge is to define a new version of a classification
                    system while allowing earlier ones to persist, which preserves resource
                    assignments in the previous version of the classification system while allowing
                    it to change in the new one. If we adopt a logical perspective on classification
                        (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.1.2" title="Classification vs. Tagging">Classification vs. Tagging</a>) that dissociates the conceptual assignment
                    of resources to categories from their physical arrangement, there is no reason
                    why a resource cannot have contrasting category assignments in different
                    versions of a classification.</p><p><a id="id645495" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645489" class="indexterm"/>However, the conventional library with collections of physical resources
                    cannot easily abandon its requirement to use a classification to arrange books
                    on shelves in specific places so they can be located, checked out, and returned
                    to the same location. This constraint does not preclude the versioning of
                    library classifications, but it increases the inertia and limits the degree of
                    change when revisions are made because of the cost and coordination
                    considerations of rearranging books in all the world’s libraries.</p><p><a id="id645598" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645611" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645624" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645507" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_flexibility_of_classification"/>A related principle
                        about maintaining classifications over time is <span class="strong"><strong>flexibility</strong></span>, the degree to which the classification can
                        accommodate new categories. Computer scientists typically describe this
                        principle as <span class="strong"><strong>extensibility</strong></span>, and library
                        scientists sometimes describe it as <span class="strong"><strong>hospitality</strong></span>.</span> In any case the concern is the same
                    and we are all familiar with it. <a id="id645651" class="indexterm"/> When you buy a bookshelf, clothes wardrobe, file cabinet, or
                    computer, it makes sense to buy one that has some extra space to accommodate the
                    books, clothes, or files you will acquire over some future timeframe. As with
                    other choices that need to be made about organizing systems, how much extra
                    space and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">organizing room</span>”</span> you will acquire involves numerous
                    tradeoffs.</p><p><a id="id645671" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645687" class="indexterm"/><a id="id645700" class="indexterm"/>Classification schemes can increase their flexibility by creating
                    extra <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">logical space</span>”</span> when they are defined. Library
                    classifications accomplish this by using naming or numbering schemes for
                    classification that can be extended easily to create new subcategories.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-28" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-28" class="footnote">403</a>]</sup> Classification schemes in information systems can also anticipate
                    the evolution of document or database schemas.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-29" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-29" class="footnote">404</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Classification Is Biased"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-7.2.3">Classification Is Biased</h3></div></div></div><p>The discipline of organizing is fundamentally about choices of properties and
                principles for describing and arranging resources. We discussed choices about
                describing resources in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3" title="The Process of Describing Resources">The Process of Describing Resources</a>, choices for creating resource
                categories in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3" title="Principles for Creating Categories">Principles for Creating Categories</a>, and choices for creating
                classifications in this chapter. The choices made reflect the purposes, experiences,
                professions, politics, values, and other characteristics and preferences of the
                people making them. As a result, every system of classification is biased because it
                takes a point of view that is a composite of all of these influences.</p><p>This claim might seem surprising, because many classification systems are formal
                and institutional, created by governments or firms participating in standards
                organizations. We expect these classifications to be impartial and objective.</p><p>Consider the classification of people as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">employed</span>”</span> or
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unemployed.</span>”</span> Many people think that any employable person who is
                not currently employed would be counted as unemployed. But the US government’s
                    <span class="orgname">Department of Labor</span> only counts someone as unemployed if they
                have actively looked for work in the past month, effectively removing anyone who has
                given up on finding work from the unemployed category by assigning them to a
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">discouraged worker</span>”</span> category. In 2012 this classification scheme
                allowed the government to report that unemployment was about 8% and falling, when in
                fact it was closer to 20% and rising. The political implications of this
                classification are substantial.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-30" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-30" class="footnote">405</a>]</sup></p><p>Bowker and Star have written extensively about biases in classification systems
                but acknowledge that many people do not see them:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Information scientists work every day on the design, delegation and
                    choice of classification systems and standards, yet few see them as artifacts
                    embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft people’s identities,
                    aspirations and dignity.</em></span><sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-31" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-31" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">406</a>]</sup></p><p>Bowker and Star describe many examples where seemingly neutral and benign
                classifications implement controversial assumptions. A striking example is found in
                the ethnic classifications of the United States Census and the categories to which
                US residents are required to assign themselves. These categories have changed nearly
                every decade since the first census in 1790 and strongly reflect political goals,
                prevailing cultural sensitivities or lack thereof, and non-scientific
                considerations. Some recent changes included a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">multi-racial</span>”</span> category,
                which some people viewed as empowering, but which was attacked by African-American
                and Hispanic civil rights groups as diluting their power.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-32" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-32" class="footnote">407</a>]</sup></p><p>A more positive way to think about bias in classification is that the choices made
                in an organizing system about resource selection, description, and arrangement come
                together to convey the values of the organizers. This makes a classification a
                rhetorical or communicative vehicle for establishing credibility and trust with
                those who interact with the resources in the classification. Seen in this light, an
                objective or neutral classification is not just hard to achieve, but also somewhat
                undesirable because it gives up the opportunity to interpret the resources in some
                creative way. Melanie Feinberg makes the point that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fair trade</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">green</span>”</span>
                supermarkets differentiate themselves by a relatively small proportion of the goods
                they offer compared with ordinary stores, but these particular items signal the
                values that their customers care most about.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-32a" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-32a" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">408</a>]</sup></p><p>Bias is clearly evident in the most widely used bibliographic classifications, the
                Library of Congress and the Dewey Decimal, which we discuss in the next
                section.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Bibliographic Classification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-7.3">Bibliographic Classification</h2></div></div></div><p>Much of our thinking about classification comes from the bibliographic domain.
            Libraries and the classification systems for the resources they contain have been
            evolving for millennia.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-33" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-33" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">409</a>]</sup> We will briefly describe the most important systems for bibliographic

However, there are several important ways in
            which bibliographic classification is distinctive and we will discuss those
            first:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p title="Scale, Complexity, and Degree of Standardization:"><span class="title"><strong>Scale, Complexity, and Degree of Standardization:</strong></span> <a id="id646243" class="indexterm"/>Department stores and supermarkets typically offer tens of
                        thousands of different items (as measured by the number of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">stock
                            keeping units</span>”</span> or <abbr class="abbrev">SKU</abbr>s), and popular online
                        commerce sites like <span class="application">Amazon.com</span> and
                            <span class="application">eBay</span> are of similar scale. However, the
                        standard product classification system for supermarkets has only about 300
                            categories.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-34" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-34" class="footnote">410</a>]</sup> The classifications for online stores are typically deeper than
                        those for physical stores, but they are highly idiosyncratic and
                        non-standard. In contrast, scores of university libraries have five million
                        or more distinct items in their collections, and they almost all use the
                        same standard bibliographic classification system that has about 300,000
                        distinct categories.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-35" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-35" class="footnote">411</a>]</sup></p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p title="Legacy of Physical Arrangement, User Access, and Re-Shelving."><span class="title"><strong>Legacy of Physical Arrangement, User Access, and Re-Shelving.</strong></span> A corollary to the previous one that distinguishes bibliographic
                        classification systems is that they have long been shaped and continue to be
                        shaped by the legacy of physical arrangement, user access to the storage
                        locations, and re-shelving that they support. These requirements constrain
                        the evolution and extensibility of bibliographic classifications, making
                        them less able to keep pace with changing concepts and new bodies of
                        knowledge. Amazon classifies the products it sells in huge warehouses, but
                        its customers do not have to pick out their purchases there, and most goods
                        never return to the warehouse. <span class="orgname">Amazon</span> can add new product
                        categories and manage the resources in warehouses far more easily than
                        libraries can.</p></li></ul></div><p><a id="id646371" class="indexterm"/>With digital libraries, constraints of scale and physical arrangement are
            substantially eliminated, because the storage location is hidden from the user and the
            resources do not need to be returned and re-shelved. However, when users can search the
            entire content of the library, as they have learned to expect from the web, they are
            less likely to use the bibliographic classification systems that have painstakingly been
            applied to the library’s resources.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Dewey Decimal Classification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-7.3.1">The Dewey Decimal Classification</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Dewey Decimal Classification</span>(DDC)</span> is the world’s most widely used bibliographic system, applied to

                booksellers how a book should be classified in physical and online bookstores.
                Because of its commercial and consumer focus, <abbr class="abbrev">BISAC</abbr> follows a
                principle of use warrant, and its categories are biased toward common language usage
                and popular culture. Some top-level <abbr class="abbrev">BISAC</abbr> categories, including
                Law, Medicine, Music, and Philosophy, are also top-level categories in the
                    <abbr class="abbrev">LCC</abbr>. However, <abbr class="abbrev">BISAC</abbr> also has top-level
                categories for Comics &amp; Graphic Novels. Cooking, Juvenile Fiction, Pets, and
                True Crime.</p><p>The differences between <abbr class="abbrev">BISAC</abbr> and the <abbr class="abbrev">LCC</abbr> are
                understandable because they are used for completely different purposes and generally
                have little need to come into contact. <a id="id647400" class="indexterm"/>But this changed in 2004, when <span class="orgname">Google</span> began its
                ambitious project to digitize the majority of the world’s books (See the Sidebar,

                be more like web search engines, so a less precise classification that uses more
                familiar category terms seems like a good choice.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-44" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-44" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">420</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Faceted Classification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-7.4">Faceted Classification</h2></div></div></div><p>We have noted several times that strictly enumerative classifications constrain how
            resources are assigned to categories and how the classification can evolve over time.
                <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">Faceted
                classifications</em></strong></span> are an alternative that overcome some of
            these limitations. <a id="id647619" class="indexterm"/><a id="id647590" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_faceted_classification"/>In a faceted classification system,
                each resource is described using properties from multiple facets, but an agent
                searching for resources does not need to consider all of the properties (and
                consequently the facets) and does not need to consider them in a fixed order, which
                an enumerative hierarchical classification requires.</span> Faceted
            classifications are especially useful in web user interfaces for online shopping or for
            browsing a large and heterogeneous museum collection. The process of considering facets
            in any order and ignoring those that are not relevant implies a dynamic organizational
            structure that makes selection both flexible and efficient. We can best illustrate these
            advantages with a shopping example in a domain that we are familiar with from <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3.3" title="Multiple Properties">Multiple Properties</a>.</p><p>If a department store offers shirts in various styles, colors, sizes, brands, and
            prices, shoppers might want to search and sort through them using properties from these
            facets in any order. However, in a physical store, this is not possible because the
            shirts must be arranged in actual locations in the store, with dress shirts in one area,
            work shirts in another, and so on.</p><p>Assume that the shirt store has shirts in four styles: dress shirts, work shirts,
            party shirts, and athletic shirts. The dress shirts come in white and blue, the work
            shirts in white and brown, and the party and athletic shirts come in white, blue, brown,
            and red. White dress shirts come in large and medium sizes.</p><p>Suppose we are looking for a white dress shirt in a large size. We can think of this
            desired shirt in two equivalent ways, either as a member of a category of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">large
                white dress shirts</span>”</span> or a shirt with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dress,</span>”</span>
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">large</span>”</span> values on style, color, and size facets.
            Because of the way the shirts are arranged in the physical store, our search process has
            to follow a hierarchical structure of categories. We go to the dress shirt section, find
            the white shirts, and then look within the white shirts for a large one. This process
            corresponds to the hierarchy shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter-7-figure-7.3a" title="Figure 7-4. Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet.">Figure 7-4</a></p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a id="chapter-7-figure-7.3a"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="chapter-7-figure-7.3ab"/><img src="figs/print/ucb-tdo-chapter7.4.1a-color.png" alt="In an enumerative classification system the order of the facets determines the classification hierarchy. &#10;                    For example, a store might classify shirts first using a style facet, &#10;                    next with a color facet, and finally with a size facet.&#10;                    This ordering could result in two piles of dress shirts, one blue and one white, &#10;                    in which each pile contains shirts of large and medium sizes."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 7-4. Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet.</div></div></div><p>Although unlikely, a store might choose to organize its shirts by color. In our search
            for a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white dress shirt in a large size,</span>”</span> if we consider the color first,
            because shirts come in four colors, there are four color categories to choose from. When
            we choose the white shirts, there is no category for work shirts because there are no
            work shirts that come in white. We then choose the dress shirts, and then finally find
            the large one. (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter-7-figure-7.3b" title="Figure 7-5. Enumerative Classification with Color Facet Followed by Style Facet.">Figure 7-5</a>)</p><p>This department store example shows that for a physical organization, one property
            facet guides the localization of resources; all other facets are subordinated under the
            primary organizing property. In hierarchical enumerative classifications, this means
            that the primary organizing facet determines the primary form of access. The shirts are
            either organized by style and then color, or by color then style, which enforces an
            inflexible query strategy (either first by style or first by color).</p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a id="chapter-7-figure-7.3b"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="chapter-7-figure-7.3ba"/><img src="figs/print/ucb-tdo-chapter7.4.1b-color.png" alt="An alternative ordering of the same shirt facets changes the classification hierarchy. &#10;                    If the first facet considered is color, style is next, and finally size, &#10;                    this ordering could result in two piles of white shirts, one for dress shirts and one for athletic shirts, &#10;                    in which each pile contains shirts of large and medium sizes."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 7-5. Enumerative Classification with Color Facet Followed by Style Facet.</div></div></div><p>In an online store, however, descriptions of the shirts are being searched and sorted
            instead of the real shirts, and different organizations are possible. When the shirts
            are described using a faceted classification system, we treat all facets independently,
            i.e. they can all be the primary facet.</p><p>We can enumerate all the properties needed to assign resources appropriately, but we
            create the categories (i.e. combination of properties from different facets) only if
            they are needed to sort resources with a particular combination of properties.</p><p>An additional aspect of the flexibility of faceted classification is that a facet can
            be left out of a resource description if it is not needed or appropriate. For example,
            because party shirts are often multi-colored with exotic patterns, it is not that useful
            to describe their color. Likewise, certain types of athletic shirts might be very
            loose-fitting, and as a result not be given a size description, but their color is
            important because it is tied to a particular team. <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter-7-figure-7.3c" title="Figure 7-6. Faceted Classification.">Figure 7-6</a> shows how these two resource types can be classified with the faceted Shirt
            classification. Resource 1 describes a party shirt in medium; resource 2 describes an
            athletic shirt in blue without information about size.</p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a id="chapter-7-figure-7.3c"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="chapter-7-figure-7.3ca"/><img src="figs/print/ucb-tdo-chapter7.4.1c-color.png" alt="In a pure faceted classification, not every facet needs to apply to every resource, &#10;                    and there is no requirement for a predetermined order in which the facets are considered."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 7-6. Faceted Classification.</div></div></div><p>A faceted classification scheme like that shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter-7-figure-7.3c" title="Figure 7-6. Faceted Classification.">Figure 7-6</a> eliminates the requirement for predetermining a
            combination and ordering of facets like those in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#chapter-7-figure-7.3a" title="Figure 7-4. Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet.">Figure 7-4</a>

            instead of having to adhere to whatever predetermined (pre-combined) enumerative
            classification the store came up with. In a digital organizing system, faceted
            classification enables highly flexible access because prioritizing different facets can

                almost mystical motivation to classify everything in the universe with a single
                classification system and notation, considering it his dharma (the closest
                translation in English would be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fundamental duty</span>”</span> or
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">destiny</span>”</span>). Facing the limitations of <span>Dewey’s system</span>, where an item’s essence had to first be identified and
                then the item assigned to a category based on that essence, Ranganathan believed
                that all bibliographic resources could be organized around a more abstract variety
                of aspects.</p><p>In 1933 Ranganathan proposed that a set of five and only five facets applied to
                all knowledge:</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="bold"><strong>P</strong></span>ersonality</dt><dd><p><span><a id="def_personality_facet"/>The type of

                used for resource identifiers uses a colon to separate the values on each facet.
                These values come from tables of categories and subcategories, making the call
                number very compact. Colon classification is most commonly used in libraries in
                    India.<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-45" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-45" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">421</a>]</sup></p><p>For example, a book on <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs by

                Medicine, a Matter facet value of Lungs with tuberculosis, an Energy facet value of
                Treatment using X-rays, a Space facet value of India, and a Time facet value of

                Ranganathan, Condorcet was concerned that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">systems of classification that

                five top-level facets would be sufficient for a universal classification system.
                People have generally rejected the idea of universal facets, but Ranganathan’s
                proposals continue to influence the development of the <em class="citetitle">Library of

                its own specific facets. This makes intuitive sense because even if resources can be
                distinguished with a general classification, doing so requires lengthy notations,
                and it is much harder to add to a general classification than to a classification
                created specifically for a single subject area. We could probably figure out a way

            places, and arrange them in activity-based groups in the preparation area?<sup>[<a id="chapter-7-endnote-58" href="#ftn.chapter-7-endnote-58" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">434</a>]</sup></p><p>Looking at the relationship between tasks and tools in this way can help a cook
            determine the best way to organize tools in a kitchen. Cutting items would necessarily
            be kept together near a prep area; having to run across the kitchen to another area
            where a poultry knife is kept with, say, chicken broth would be detrimental to the
            cook’s workflow. It would make far more sense to have all of the items for the task of
            cutting in a single area.</p><p>The intentional arrangement of tools in a working kitchen might look something like

            learning technique known as clustering to create a system of categories for classifying
            a set of resources or documents for which measures of inter-item similarity can be
            calculated. Clustering programs do not start with a set of resources that are already
            classified, making them <span class="strong"><strong>unsupervised</strong></span> techniques. The
            categories they create maximize the similarity of resources within a category and
            maximize the differences between them, but these statistically-designed categories are
            not always meaningful ones that can be named and used by people. We ended <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a> by suggesting that it is often better to
            start with a designed classification scheme and then train computers with <span class="strong"><strong>supervised</strong></span> learning techniques to assign new resources to
            the categories.</p><p>A familiar example of supervised machine learning to classify resources is email spam
            filtering. Messages are classified as SPAM or HAM (i.e., non-SPAM); the former are sent

                    explicitly for training the classification algorithm, or extracted from regular

                            actions and prevent conflicts by imposing a single solution on all the
                            participants in a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">top-down</span>”</span> manner. <a class="link" href="bi01.html#Rosenthal2004" title="“From semantic integration to semantics management: case studies and a way forward”"><a id="cite_Rosenthal2004-7.1"/>(Rosenthal,

                                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">person-concept</span>”</span> tradeoff, which we can paraphrase as

                                agree on a little.</span>”</span></p><p>This authority can come from many different sources, but they can be
                            roughly categorized as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">authority from power</span>”</span> and
                                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">authority from consensus.</span>”</span> Often the economic
                            dominance of a firm allows it to control how business gets done in its
                            industry. One key part of that is establishing specifications for data
                            formats and classification schemes in organizing systems, which usually
                            means requiring other firms to use the ones developed by the dominant
                            firm for its own use. This ensures the continued efficiency of their own
                            business processes while making it harder for other firms to challenge
                            their market power.</p><p>In contrast, consensus is the authority mechanism embodied in the
                            workings of the open source community, where the freedom to view and
                            change data formats and code that uses them encourages cooperation and
                            adoption. Consensus also underlies the authority of voluntary standards
                            activities, where firms work together under the auspices of a standards
                            body and agree to follow its procedures for creating, ratifying, and
                            implementing standards.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-7-endnote-12"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-7-endnote-12" class="para">387</a>] </sup>[Business] <a id="id643342" class="indexterm"/><a id="id643369" class="indexterm"/><a id="id643418" class="indexterm"/><a id="id643423" class="indexterm"/><a id="id643357" class="indexterm"/>International and national standards bodies derive their

                            standards organizations arguably derive most of their authority from the
                            collective power of their members, because many influential standards

                            sponsored by governments. In addition, firms often create <span xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase"><em xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span>
                            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">quasi-standards</span>”</span> organizations or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">communities of

                            often incompatible on purpose. At first this lets each standard attract
                            customers with features not enabled by the other, but it ends up locking
                            them in by imposing switching costs.

                            discrimination, and they (should seek to) minimize cost to taxpayers.
                            Each of these principles is an independent argument for standards and
                            taken together they make a very strong one. Indeed, one the founding
                            goals in the US Constitution is to protect the public interest, and this
                            is enabled in Article I, Section 8 by granting Congress the power to set
                            standards <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">of Weights and Measures</span>”</span> to facilitate commerce.

The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">War of 1812</span>”</span> lasted well
                        into 1815. The persistence of an inaccurate name for this war reflects its
                        unique characteristics. Wars (in the English language) are generally named
                        for the location of the fighting or the enemy being fought (the
                        Mexican-American War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War), or for
                        a particular ideal or ambition (the Revolutionary War, the Civil War). The
                        War of 1812 does not satisfy any of these naming conventions; the war was
                        fought across a huge range of geography from eastern Canada to Louisiana,
                        between a diverse range of groups from Canadians and Native American tribes,
                        with national armies getting involved very late in the war. While nominally
                        fought over freedom the seas, the war quickly morphed into one about
                        territorial ambition in North America. Of course, if the world were a place
                        where people could agree on naming standards for wars, it is likely we would
                        no longer have wars. See
