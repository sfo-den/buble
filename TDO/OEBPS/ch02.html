            follows from the rich associations the curator has accumulated around the concept of

            the shared concept of <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_maintaining"><em class="glossterm">maintenance</em></a> to
            bridge their disciplines, this learning could not take place.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="chapter-2-sidebar-1"/><div class="sidebar-title">What about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Creating</span>”</span> Resources?</div><p>Our definition of organizing system as an intentionally arranged collection of
                resources might seem to imply that resources must exist before they are organized.
                This is often the case when we organize <span class="hardware">physical resources</span>
                because the need for principled organization only arises when the collection gets
                too big for us to see everything in the collection at once.</p><p>However, organizing systems for digital resources are often put in place as a
                prerequisite for creating them. This is always necessary when the resources are
                created by automated processes or data entry in business systems, and usually the
                case with <span class="hardware">professional writers</span> in a technical publications
                context. We can think of database or document schemas (at the implementation tier)
                or data entry forms or word processor templates (in the user interface tier) as
                embodiments of the organizing principles in the data records or documents that are
                then created in conformance with them.</p></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.2.1" title="The Concept of “Resource”">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Resource</span>”</span></a> and <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3.2" title="What Is Being Organized?">What Is Being Organized?</a> we briefly
            discussed the fundamental concept of a <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_resource"><em class="glossterm">resource</em></a>. In this chapter, we describe the four primary <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_activities"><em class="glossterm">activities</em></a> with resources, using examples
            from many different kinds of organizing systems. We emphasize the activities of
            organizing and of designing resource-based interactions that make use of the
            organization imposed on the resources. We discuss <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_selecting"><em class="glossterm">selection</em></a> and <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_maintaining"><em class="glossterm">maintenance</em></a> to create the context for the organizing <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_activities"><em class="glossterm">activities</em></a> and to highlight the

            these other <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_activities"><em class="glossterm">activities</em></a>. This broad
            survey enables us to compare and contrast the activities in different resource domains,
            setting the stage for a more thorough discussion of resources and <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_description_resource"><em class="glossterm">resource description</em></a> in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter 3</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter 4</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Selecting Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-2.2">Selecting Resources</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="id591059" class="indexterm"/>When we talk about organizing systems, we often do so in terms of the contents of
            their collections. This implies that <span>the most fundamental decision for an
                organizing system is determining its resource domain, the group or type of resources
                that are being organized</span>. This decision is usually a constraint, not a
            choice; we acquire or encounter some resources that we need to interact with over time,
            and we need to organize them so we can do that effectively.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="action">Selecting</span></strong></span> is the process by which
            resources are identified, evaluated, and then added to a collection in an organizing
            system. <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_selecting"><em class="glossterm">Selection</em></a> is first shaped by
            the domain and then by the scope of the organizing system, which can be analyzed through
            six interrelated aspects:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>the number and nature of users</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the time span or lifetime over which the organizing system is expected to
                    operate</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the size of the collection</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the expected changes to the collection</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the physical or technological environment in which the organizing system is
                    situated or implemented</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the relationship of the organizing system to other ones that overlap with it
                    in domain or scope.</p></li></ol></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. The Organizing System Roadmap">Chapter 10</a>, we discuss these six aspects in more detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="Selecting {and, or, vs.} Organizing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-2.2.1">Selecting {and, or, vs.} Organizing</h3></div></div></div><p>Many types of resources are inevitably evaluated one-at-a-time. It is impossible
                to specify in advance every property or criterion that might be considered in making
                a selection decision, especially for <span class="hardware">unique or rare resources</span>
                like those being considered by a museum or private collector. As a result,
                organizing activities typically occur after selection takes place, as in the closet
                organizing system with which we began this chapter.</p><p>When the resources being considered for a collection are more homogeneous and
                predictable, it is possible to specify selection criteria and organizing principles
                in advance. This makes selection and organizing into concurrent activities. You
                expect your email in-box will receive spam messages, so you might as well create a
                spam folder where the spam filter can deposit the messages it classifies as
                spam.</p><p>Some organizing systems acquire all resources of a particular type or from a
                particular source. Resources are then automatically added to the collection
                according to an organizing decision that need be made only for the first resource,
                with subsequent resources further organized according to properties that minimally
                distinguish them from each other, like their creation or acquisition dates. <a id="id591186" class="indexterm"/> Syndicated or subscription resources like news feeds or serial
                publications are most often organized in this manner, where the organization imposed
                on the first resource acquired is replicated for each subsequent one. If you
                subscribe to a <span class="hardware">printed magazine</span>, the magazines undoubtedly end
                up in a stack or pile with the most recent issue on the top.</p><p>Finally, as we pointed out in the Sidebar, <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#chapter-2-sidebar-1" title="What about “Creating” Resources?">What about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Creating</span>”</span> Resources?</a>
                selection can sometimes follow organizing. An order management system cannot add new
                orders until it has a defined schema for creating them.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Selection Principles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-2.2.2">Selection Principles</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong><span class="action">Selection</span></strong></span> must be an intentional
                process because, by definition, an organizing system contains resources whose
                selection and arrangement was determined by human or computational agents, not by
                natural processes. <span>Selection methods and criteria vary across resource
                    domains.</span>
                <span>Resource selection policies are often shaped by laws, regulations or
                    policies that require or prohibit the collection of certain kinds of objects or
                    types of information.</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-01" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-01" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">36</a>]</sup></p><p><span>Libraries typically <span class="action">select resources</span> on the basis of
                    their utility and relevance to their user populations, and try to choose
                    resources that add the most value to their existing collections.</span>
                <span>Museums often emphasize intrinsic value, scarcity, or uniqueness as
                    selection criteria, even if the resources lack any contemporary use.
                </span>Both libraries and museums typically formalize their selection principles

                    development</em></a> policies that establish priorities for acquiring

            However, most organizing systems use principles that are based on specific resource
            properties or properties derived from the collection as a whole. What properties are
            significant and how to think about them depends on the number of resources being
            organized, the purposes for which they are being organized, and on the experiences and
            implicit or explicit biases of the intended users of the organizing system. The
            implementation of the organizing system also shapes the need for, and the nature of, the

            the resource is selected and becomes part of the collection. <span>Decisions about

                information services have some important differences from those that organize
                physical resources. Because digital resources can be easily copied or interlinked,
                they are free from the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><span class="hardware">one place at a time</span></span>”</span>
                    limitation.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-13" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-13" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">48</a>]</sup> The actual <span class="hardware">storage locations</span> for digital resources
                are no longer visible or very important. It hardly matters if a digital document or
                video resides on a computer in Berkeley or Bangalore if it can be located and
                accessed efficiently.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-14" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-14" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">49</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id593044" class="indexterm"/>Moreover, because the functions and capabilities of digital resources are not
                directly manifested as physical properties, the constraints imposed on all
                    <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_materiality"><em class="glossterm">material</em></a> objects do not
                matter to digital content in many circumstances.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-15" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-15" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">50</a>]</sup>

                resources that are associated with them. Since the incremental costs of adding
                processing and <span class="hardware">storage capacity</span> to digital organizing systems
                are small, collections of both primary digital resources and description resources
                can be arbitrarily large. Digital organizing systems can support collections and
                interactions at a scale that is impossible in organizing systems that are entirely
                physical, and they can implement services and functions that exploit the
                exponentially growing processing, storage and communication capabilities available
                    today.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-17" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-17" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">52</a>]</sup></p><p><span>There are inherently more choices in the arrangement of digital resources
                    than there are for physical ones, but this difference emerges because of
                    multiple implementation platforms for the organizing system as much as in the
                    nature of the resources.</span> Nevertheless, the organizing systems for
                digital books, music and video collections often maintain the distinctions embodied
                in the organizing system for physical resources because it enables their
                co-existence or simply because of legacy inertia. As a result, the organizing
                systems for collections of digital resources tend to be coarsely distinguished by
                media type (e.g., document management, digital music collection, digital video
                collection, digital photo collection, etc.).</p><p>Information resources in either physical or digital form are typically organized
                using intrinsic properties like author names, creation dates, publisher, or the set
                of words that they contain. Information resources can also be organized using
                extrinsic or behavioral properties like subject classifications, assigned names or
                identifiers, or even access frequency.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-18" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-18" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup></p><p>Complex organization and interactions are possible when organizing systems with
                digital resources are based on the data type or data model of the digital content
                (e.g., text, numeric, multimedia, statistical, geospatial, logical, scientific, or
                personnel data). These distinctions are often strongly identifiable with business
                functions: operational, transactional and process control activities require the
                most fine-grained data, while strategic functions might rely on more qualitative
                analyses represented in narrative text formats. Managerial and decision support

                ones. <span>Many information systems that generate or collect transactional data

                <span>The top level categories of resources are created based on the values of the

                    other properties until each resource is classified in only a single
                    category.</span> A typical example of hierarchical arrangement for digital
                resources is the system of directories or folders used by a professor to arrange his
                personal document collection in a computer file system; the first level

                Chardonnay, but one of them might have started the search based on price, one based
                on the grape varietal, and the third with the region. This kind of interaction in
                effect generates a different logical hierarchy for every different combination of

                    descriptive facets, depending on the priority or point of view the user applies

                <a id="id594675" class="indexterm"/> The tradeoffs between the amount of work that goes into organizing a
                collection of resources and the amount of work required to find and use them are
                inescapable when the resources are physical objects or information resources are in
                    <span class="hardware">physical form</span>. <span>We can immediately see that storing

                organizing system for your clothes closet, you can see the number and arrangement of
                the shelves and consider the tradeoff between extensive and minimal organization and
                the implications for the amount of interaction effort required to put away and find
                    <span class="hardware">clothes</span> in each case.</p><p>What and how to count to compare the capabilities of organizing systems becomes
                more challenging the further we get from collections of static <span class="hardware">physical
                    resources</span>, like books or shoes, where it is usually easy to perceive
                and understand the possible interactions. With computers, information systems, and
                digital resources in general, considerations about affordances and capabilities are
                not as straightforward. First, the affordances we can perceive might not be tied to
                any useful interaction. <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Donald</span> <span class="surname">Norman</span></span> joked that every computer screen within reaching distance affords
                touching, but unless the display is touch-sensitive, this affordance only benefits
                companies that sell screen-cleaning materials.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-28" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-28" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">63</a>]</sup></p><p>Second, most of the interactions that are supported by digital resources are not
                apparent when you encounter them. You cannot tell from their names, but you probably
                know from past experience what interactions are possible with files of types

                measure does not take into account differences in the capability or generality of a
                particular interaction. For example, two organizing systems might both have a search
                function, but differences in the operators they allow, the sophistication of
                pre-processing of the content to create index terms, or their usability can make

                    necessarily makes a system better or more capable; what matters is how much

                goals of efficiency, revenue generation and competitive advantage. The same

                goal of most business organizing systems. These organizing systems mostly manage
                information needed to carry out day-to-day operations or relatively recent
                historical information used in decision support and strategic planning. In addition
                to these internal mandates, businesses have to conform to securities, taxation, and
                compliance regulations that impose requirements for long-term information

                generally do not. Art galleries are an interesting hybrid because they organize and
                preserve collections that are valuable, but if they do not manage to sell some
                things, they will not stay in business.</p><p>In between these contrasting purposes of <span class="action">preservation</span> and
                    <span class="action">maintenance</span> are the motives in personal collections, which
                occasionally are created because of the inherent value of the items but more
                typically because of their value in supporting personal activities. Some people

                        access to it within a year or two after its creation.</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-55" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-55" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">90</a>]</sup></p><p>However, limits to the <span class="hardware">physical lifetime</span> of digital
                    storage media are much less significant than the third challenge, the fact that

                        is a worldwide partnership of several dozen major research institutions and libraries 
                        dedicated to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">collecting, organizing, preserving, communicating, and sharing 
                            the record of human knowledge.</span>”</span>  
                        The Hathi Trust was established in 2008 to coordinate the efforts of libraries 
                        in managing the digital copies of the books they received 
                        in return for providing books to Google for its book digitization projects.  
                        Since then the Hathi Trust has broadened its scope to include the public domain books 
                        collected by the Internet Archive and numerous other digital collections, 
                        and today its digital library has over ten million volumes. 
                        The costs of running the Hathi Trust and its digital library are shared 
                        in a transparent manner by the institutions that contributed digital collections 
                        or that want access to them, which reduces the costs for everyone 
                        compared to a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">go it alone</span>”</span> strategy.  
                        The Hathi Trust Digital Library has separate modes for catalog 
                        search and full-text search of the library contents, 
                        unlike commercial search engines that do not distinguish them.  
                        A second important difference between the Hathi Trust Digital Library 
                        and commercial search engines is the absence of display advertising 
                        and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">sponsored search</span>”</span> results.</p></div><p>Because almost every digital device has storage associated with it, problems
                    posed by multiple storage environments can arise at all scales of organizing
                    systems. Only a few years ago people often struggled with migrating files from
                    their old computer, music player or phone when they got new ones.
                        <span>Web-based email and applications and web-based storage services like
                            <span class="application">Dropbox</span>, <span class="application">Amazon Cloud
                            Drive</span>, and <span class="application">Apple iCloud</span>
                        eliminate some data storage and migration problems by making them someone
                        else’s responsibility, but in doing so introduce privacy and reliability
                        concerns.</span></p><p>It is easy to say that the solutions to the problems of digital preservation
                    are regular recopying of the digital resources onto new storage media and then
                    migrating them to new formats when significantly better ones come along. In
                    practice, however, how libraries, businesses, government agencies or other
                    enterprises deal with these problems depends on their budgets and on their
                    technical sophistication. In addition, not every resource should or can always
                    be migrated, and the co-existence of multiple storage technologies makes an
                    organizing system more complex because different storage formats and devices can
                    be collectively incompatible. Dealing with interoperability and integration

                    Unlike libraries, museums, archives, and many other kinds of organizing systems
                    that contain collections of unchanging resources, organizing systems on the web
                    often contain resources that are highly dynamic. Some websites change by adding
                    content, and others change by editing or removing it.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-57" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-57" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">92</a>]</sup></p><p>Longitudinal studies have shown that hundreds of millions of web pages change
                    at least once a week, even though most web pages never change or change

                    hardly sufficient to preserve it if it not popular and relevant enough to show
                    up in the first few pages of search results. <span>Persistent access requires
                        preservation, but preservation isn’t meaningful if there is no realistic
                        probability of future access.</span></p><p>Comprehensive web search engines like <span class="application">Google</span> and
                        <span class="application">Bing</span> use <span class="application">crawlers</span> to
                    continually update their indexed collections of web pages and their search
                    results link to the current version, so preservation of older versions is
                    explicitly not a goal. Furthermore, search engines don’t reveal any details
                    about how frequently they update their collections of indexed pages.<sup>[<a id="chapter-2-endnote-59" href="#ftn.chapter-2-endnote-59" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">94</a>]</sup></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="chapter-2-sidebar-3"/><div class="sidebar-title">The Internet Archive and the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Wayback Machine</span>”</span></div><p>The <span class="orgname">Internet Archive</span> (<span class="bold"><strong><span class="application">Archive.org</span></strong></span>), founded by

The essence of

                        components that can be combined as needed. An <abbr class="abbrev">SOA</abbr> enables a
                        business to quickly and cost-effectively change how it does business and
                        whom it does business with (suppliers, business partners, or customers).
                            <abbr class="abbrev">SOA</abbr> is generally implemented using web services that
                        exchange <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> documents in real-time information flows to
                        interconnect the business service components. If the business service
                        components are described abstractly it can be possible for one service
                        provider to be transparently substituted for another<span class="symbol">—</span>a kind of 
                        real-time resource selection<span class="symbol">—</span>to maintain the desired quality of service. For
                        example, a web retailer might send a Shipping Request to many delivery
                        services, one of which is selected to provide the service. It probably does
                        not matter to the customer which delivery service handles his package, and
                        it might not even matter to the retailer.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-2-endnote-06"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-2-endnote-06" class="para">41</a>] </sup>[Business] <a id="id591689" class="indexterm"/>The idea that a firm’s long term success can depend on just a
