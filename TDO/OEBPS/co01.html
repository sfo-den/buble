        by <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jen</span> <span class="surname">Wang</span></span>. The cover font is HTF Knockout. 
    (A concept involving progressive organization of wooden alphabet blocks was rejected as suggesting a children’s book.)</p><p>The authors and editors managed their textual content on DropBox using various versions of Microsoft Word.
        Those Word documents were transformed into DocBook representations using scripts and hand editing.
        The DocBook files were then encoded with extensive semantic tagging and hypertext relationships, 
        including references and transclusion of content from the chapters into the glossary. 
        The editors used oXygen, XML Spy and XMetaL word processors on OS X and Windows platforms.
        Customized XSLT scripts transformed the DocBook files into XHTML 5 which then served as the basis for 
        further transformations using CSS and/or XSLT to produce the printed, PDF, XHTML, ePub or Mobi format document 
        that you are reading now.</p><p>The printed edition of <em class="citetitle">The Discipline of Organizing</em> 
        was built with <a class="ulink" href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com" target="_top">Altas</a> from O’Reilly Media.
        The content of the printed book uses OpenType DejaVu fonts. 
        We started with the source files 
        (<a class="ulink" href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_top"><code class="uri">http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page</code></a>) 
        to generate custom OTF versions. 
        The text font is DejaVuSerif; 
        the heading font is DejaVuSans.
        The monospaced font used for code samples and literal text is DejaVuMono. 
        The condensed font used in the index is DejaVuSerifCondensed; 
        some labels use DejaVuSansCondensed.
    A small number of characters require a Unicode font to represent them;
    the Unicode font used for print and PDF versions of this book is Adobe Song Standard.
    Emphasis is presented in italic and bold faces of the corresponding font families.</p><p>The electronic book editions (ePub 2 and ePub 3) were built using customized XSLT scripts created by Bob Stayton,
