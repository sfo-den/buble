                    structure.</strong></span></span> Organizing is such a common activity that we
            often do it without thinking much about it. We organize the shoes in our closet, the
            books on our book shelves, the spices in our kitchen, and the folders into which we file
            information for tax and other purposes. Quite a few of us have jobs that involve
            specific types of organizing tasks. We might even have been explicitly trained to
            perform them by following specialized disciplinary practices. We might learn to do these
            tasks very well, but even then we often do not reflect on the similarity of the
            organizing tasks we do and those done by others, or on the similarity of those we do at
            work and those we do at home. We take for granted and as givens the concepts and methods
            used in the Organizing System we work with most often.</p><p>The goal of this book is to help readers become more self-conscious about what it
            means to organize things<span class="symbol">—</span>whether they are physical resources
            like printed books and shoes or digital resources like web pages and MP3 files<span class="symbol">—</span>and about the principles by which the resources are
            organized. In particular, this book introduces the concept of an <a id="id580960" class="indexterm"/><a id="id580941" class="indexterm"/><a id="id580929" class="indexterm"/><span class="definition"><a id="def_organizing_system"/><span class="strong"><strong><em class="firstterm"><a id="first_organizing_system"/><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_organizing_system"><em class="glossterm">Organizing

                    intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions they
                    support.</strong></span></span> The book analyzes the design decisions that go into
            any systematic organization of resources and the design patterns for the interactions
            that make use of the resources.</p><p>This book evolved from a master’s level university course on <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Information
                Organization &amp; Retrieval</span>”</span> I taught for several years at the <em class="firstterm"><a id="first_UCBiSchool"/><span class="orgname">University of California, Berkeley</span>’s <span class="orgname">School of
                    Information</span></em>. My goal was to synthesize insights from
                <span>library science</span>, <span>information science</span>,
                <span>cognitive science</span>, <span>systems analysis</span>, and
                <span>computer science</span> to provide my students with a richer understanding
            about <span>information organization</span> than any discipline alone could provide.
            I came to realize that information was just one of the many types of resources to
            organize and that it would be beneficial to think about the <span>art and science of
                organizing</span> in a more abstract way. This book is the product of countless
            discussions with students and faculty colleagues at <span class="orgname">Berkeley</span> and
            other schools, and we are collaboratively developing a new discipline that unifies four
            types of organizing, as follows:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We organize physical things.</strong></span> Each of us organizes
            many kinds of <span class="hardware">things</span> in our lives<span class="symbol">—</span>our books
            on bookshelves; printed financial records in folders and filing cabinets; clothes in
            dressers and closets; cooking and eating utensils in kitchen drawers and cabinets.
            Public libraries organize printed books, periodicals, maps, CDs, DVDs, and maybe some
            old record albums. Research libraries also organize rare manuscripts, pamphlets, musical
            scores, and many other kinds of printed information. Museums organize paintings,
            sculptures, and other artifacts of cultural, historical, or scientific value. Stores and
            suppliers organize their goods for sale to consumers and to each other.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>We organize information about physical things.</strong></span> Each
            of us organizes information about things, when we inventory the <span class="hardware">contents of
                our house</span> for insurance purposes, when we sell our <span class="hardware">unwanted
                stuff</span> on eBay, or when we rate a restaurant on
                <span class="application">Yelp</span>. Library card catalogs, and their online
            replacements, tell us what books a library’s collection contains and where to find them.
                <span class="hardware">Sensors</span> and <span class="hardware">RFID tags</span> track the movement
            of goods<span class="symbol">—</span>even library books<span class="symbol">—</span>through supply chains, and the movement (or lack of
            movement) of <span class="hardware">cars</span> on highways.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We organize digital things</strong></span>. Each of us organizes
            personal digital information<span class="symbol">—</span>email, documents, e-books, MP3 and
            video files, appointments, and contacts<span class="symbol">—</span>on our computers, smart
            phone, e-book readers or in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the cloud,</span>”</span> through information services that
            use Internet protocols. Large research libraries organize digital journals and books,
            computer programs, government and scientific datasets, databases, and many other kinds
            of digital information. Companies organize their digital business records and customer
            information in enterprise applications, content repositories, and databases. Hospitals
            and medical clinics maintain and exchange electronic health records and digital X-rays
            and scans.</p><p><a id="id581150" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>We organize information about digital
                things</strong></span>. Digital library catalogs, web portals and aggregation websites
            organize links to other digital resources. Web search engines use content and link
            analysis along with relevance ratings to organize the billions of web pages competing
            for our attention. Web-based services, data feeds and other information resources can be
            combined as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mash-ups</span>”</span> or choreographed to carry out information-intensive
            business models.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at these four different types or contexts of organizing. Are
            there clear, systematic and useful distinctions between them? We contrasted
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">organizing things</span>”</span> with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">organizing information.</span>”</span> At
            first glance it might seem that organizing physical things like books, compact discs,
            machine parts, or cooking utensils has an entirely different character than organizing
            intangible digital things. We often arrange physical things according to their shapes,
            sizes, material of manufacture, or other visible properties; for example, we might
            arrange our shirts in the clothes closet by style and color, and we might organize our
            music collection by separating the old vinyl albums from the CDs. We might arrange books
            on bookshelves by their sizes, putting all the big heavy picture books on the bottom
            shelf. Organization for clothes and information artifacts in tangible formats that is
            based on visible properties does not seem much like how you store and organize digital
            books on your Kindle or arrange digital music on your music player. Arranging, storing,
            and accessing X-rays printed on film might appear to have little in common with these
            activities when the X-rays are in digital form.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that organizing things and organizing information sometimes do
            not differ much when information is represented in a tangible way. The era of ubiquitous
            digital information of the last decade or two is just a blip in time compared with the
            more than ten thousand years of human experience with information carved in stone,
            etched in clay, or printed with ink on papyrus, parchment or paper. These tangible
            information artifacts have deeply embedded the notion of information as a physical thing
            in culture, language, and methods of information design and organization. This
            perspective toward tangible information artifacts is especially prominent in rare book
            collections where books are revered as physical objects with a focus on their
            distinctive binding, calligraphy, and typesetting.</p><p>Nevertheless, at other times there are substantial differences in how we organize
            things and how we organize information, even when the latter is in physical form. We
            more often organize our <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">information things</span>”</span> according to what they are
            about rather than on the basis of their visible properties. At home we sort our CDs by
            artist or genre; we keep cookbooks separate from travel books, and fiction books apart
            from reference books. Libraries employ subject-based classification schemes that have a
            few hundred thousand distinct categories.</p><p>Likewise, there are times when we pay little attention to the visible properties of
            tangible things when we organize them and instead arrange them according to functional
            or task properties. We keep screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a saw, a drill, and a level
            in a tool box or together on a work bench, even though they have few visual properties
            in common. We are not organizing them because of what we see about them, but because of
            what we know about to use them, The task-based organization of the tools has some
            similarity to the subject-based organization of the library.</p><p>We also contrasted <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">organizing things</span>”</span> with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">organizing information
                about things.</span>”</span> This difference seems clear if we consider the traditional
            library card catalog, whose printed cards describe and specify the location of books on
            library shelves. When the things and the information about them are both in physical
            format, it is easy to see that the former is a primary resource and the latter a
            surrogate or associated resource that describes or relates to it.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="chapter-1-sidebar-1"/><div class="sidebar-title">What Is Information?</div><p>Geoff Nunberg has eloquently explained in <a class="link" href="bi01.html#Nunberg1996" title="“Farewell to the Information Age”"><em class="citetitle">Farewell to the Information
                    Age</em></a> that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Information</span>”</span> is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">a collection of
                    notions, rather than a single coherent concept.</span>”</span> Most of its hundreds of
                definitions treat it as an idea that swirls around equally hard-to-define terms like
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">data,</span>”</span>
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">knowledge,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">communication.</span>”</span> Moreover, these
                intellectual and ideological perspectives on information coexist with more mundane
                uses of the term, as when we ask a station agent: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Can you give me some
                    information about the train schedule?</span>”</span></p><p>An abstract view of information as an intangible thing is the intellectual
                foundation for both modern information science and the information economy and
                society. Nevertheless, the abstract view of information often conflicts with the
                much older idea that information is a tangible thing that naturally arose when
                information was inextricably encoded in material formats. We often blur the sense of
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">information as content</span>”</span> with the sense of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">information as
                    container,</span>”</span> and we too easily treat the number of stored bits on a
                computer or in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the cloud</span>”</span> as a measure of information content or
                value.</p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Michael</span> <span class="surname">Buckland</span></span>’s oft-cited essay <a class="link" href="bi01.html#Buckland1991" title="“Information as thing”"><em class="citetitle">Information as Thing</em></a> rebuts
                the notion that information is inherently intangible and instead defines it more
                broadly and provocatively based on function. This makes the objects in museum or
                personal collections into information-as-thing resources because they can be learned
                from and serve as evidence.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-01" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-01" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup></p></div><p>When it comes to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">organizing information about digital things</span>”</span> the
            contrast is much less clear, When you search for a book using a search engine, first you
            get the catalog description of the book, and if you’re lucky the book itself is just a
            click away. When the things and the information about them are both digital, the
            contrast we posed is not as sharp as when one or both of them is in a physical format.
            And while we used X-rays<span class="symbol">—</span>on film or in digital format<span class="symbol">—</span>as examples of things we might organize, when a physician
            studies an X-ray, is it not being used as information about the subject of the X-ray,
            namely the patient?</p><p>These differences and relationships between <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><span class="strong"><strong>physical
                    things</strong></span></span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><span class="strong"><strong>digital
                    things</strong></span></span>”</span> have long been discussed and debated by philosophers,
            linguists, psychologists and others (See the Sidebar, <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter-1-sidebar-1" title="What Is Information?">What Is Information?</a>).</p><p><a id="id581478" class="indexterm"/>The distinctions among organizing physical things, organizing digital things, or
            organizing information about physical things or digital things are challenging to
            describe because many of the words we might use are as overloaded with multiple meanings
            as information itself. For example, some people use the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">document</span>”</span> to
            refer only to traditional physical forms, while others use it more abstractly to refer
            to any self-contained unit of information independent of its instantiation in physical
            or digital form. The most abstract definition, presented in <em class="citetitle">What is a
                Document?</em> is when Buckland provocatively asserts that an antelope is
            both <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">information as thing</span>”</span> and also a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">document</span>”</span> when it is
            in a zoo, even though it is just an animal when it is running wild on the plains of
            Africa. Similar definitional variation occurs with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">author</span>”</span> or
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">creator.</span>”</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-02" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-02" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup></p><p>If we allow the concept of information to be anything we can study<span class="symbol">—</span>to be 
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">anything that informs</span>”</span><span class="symbol">—</span>the concept becomes unbounded. 
            Our goal in this book is to
            bridge the intellectual gulf that separates the many disciplines that share the goal of
            organizing but that differ in what they organize. This requires us to focus on
            situations where information exists because of intentional acts to create or
            organize.</p><p>
Many of the foundational topics for a discipline of organizing have traditionally been
            presented from the perspective of the public sector library and taught as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library
                and information science.</span>”</span> These include bibliographic description,
            classification, naming, authority control, and information standards. We need to update
            and extend the coverage of these topics to include more private sector and
            non-bibliographic contexts, multi- and social-media, and new information-intensive
            applications and service systems enabled by mobile, pervasive, and scientific computing.
            In so doing we can reframe the foundational concepts to make them equally compatible
            with the disciplinary perspectives of informatics, data and process modeling, and
            document engineering.</p><p>We also need to take a transdisciplinary view that lets us emphasize what the different disciplines have in common rather than what distinguishes them. Resource selection,
organizing, interaction design, and maintenance are taught in every discipline, but these concepts go by different names. A vocabulary for discussing common
organizing challenges and issues that might be otherwise obscured by narrow
disciplinary perspectives helps us understand existing systems of organizing better
while also suggesting how to invent new ones by making different design
choices. </p><p><a id="id581673" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="chapter-1-sidebar-2"/><div class="sidebar-title">The Discipline of Organizing</div><p><a id="id581660" class="indexterm"/><span class="definition"><a id="def_discipline"/>A <span class="strong"><strong><em class="firstterm"><a id="first_discipline"/><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_discipline"><em class="glossterm">discipline</em></a></em></strong></span>

                issue in many disciplines, most notably library and information science, computer
                science, systems analysis, informatics, law, economics, and business. However, these
                disciplines have only limited agreement in how they approach problems of organizing
                and in what they seek as their solutions. For example, library and information
                science has traditionally studied organizing from a public sector bibliographic
                perspective, paying careful attention to user requirements for access and
                preservation, and offering prescriptive methods and solutions.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-03" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-03" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> In contrast, computer science and informatics tend to study organizing
                in the context of information-intensive business applications with a focus on
                process efficiency, system architecture and implementation.</p><p>This book presents a more abstract framework for issues and problems of organizing
                that emphasizes the common concepts and goals of the disciplines that study them.

                    is a set of concepts that provide the basic structure for understanding a
                    domain, enabling a common vocabulary for different explanatory
                    theories.</span> Our framework proposes that every system of organization
                involves a collection of resources, and we can treat physical things, digital
                things, and information about such things as resources. Every system of organization
                involves a choice of properties or principles used to describe and arrange the
                resources, and ways of supporting interactions with the resources. By comparing and
                contrasting how these activities take place in different contexts and domains, we
                can identify patterns of organizing and see that Organizing Systems often follow a
                common life cycle. We can create a discipline of organizing in a disciplined
                way.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="The “Organizing System” Concept"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-1.2">The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Organizing System</span>”</span> Concept</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="id581927" class="indexterm"/>We propose to unify many perspectives about organizing and information with the

            resources is described and arranged to enable human or computational agents to interact
            with the resources. The Organizing System is an architectural and conceptual view that
            is distinct from the physical arrangement of resources that might embody it, and also
            distinct from the person, enterprise, or institution that implements and operates it.
            These distinctions are sometimes hard to maintain in ordinary language; for example, we
            might describe some set of resource descriptions, organizing principles, and supported
            interactions as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library</span>”</span> Organizing System. However, we also need at
            times to refer to a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library</span>”</span> as the institution in which this Organizing
            System operates, and of course the idea of a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library</span>”</span> as a physical
            facility is deeply engrained in language and culture.</p><p><a id="id581987" class="indexterm"/><a id="id581984" class="indexterm"/>Our concept of the Organizing System was in part inspired by and generalizes
            to physical and web-based resource domains the concepts proposed in 2000 for
            bibliographic domains by <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Elaine</span> <span class="surname">Svenonius</span></span> in <em class="citetitle">The Intellectual Foundation of Information
                Organization</em>. She recognized that the traditional information
            organization activities of bibliographic description and cataloging were complemented,
            and partly compensated for, by automated text processing and indexing that were usually
            treated as part of a separate discipline of information retrieval. <a id="id582064" class="indexterm"/>
            <a id="id582054" class="indexterm"/> She proposed that decisions about organizing information and decisions
            about retrieving information were inherently linked by a tradeoff principle and thus
            needed to be viewed as an interconnected system: <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">The effectiveness of a
                    system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put
                    into organizing it</span>”</span> (p.ix)</em></span>. We celebrate and build upon her
            insights by beginning each of the sub-parts of <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3" title="Design Decisions in Organizing Systems">Design Decisions in Organizing Systems</a> with a quote from her book.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-04" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-04" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id582091" class="indexterm"/>A systems view of information organization and information retrieval
            captures and provides structure for the inherent tradeoffs obscured by the silos of
            traditional disciplinary and category perspectives: the more effort put into organizing
            information, the more effectively it can be retrieved, and the more effort put into
            retrieving information, the less it needs to be organized first. A systems view no
            longer contrasts information organization as a human activity and information retrieval
            as a machine activity, or information organization as a topic for library and
            information science and information retrieval as one for computer science. Instead, we
            readily see that computers now assist people in organizing and that people contribute
            much of the information used by computers to enable retrieval.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Concept of “Resource”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-1.2.1">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Resource</span>”</span></h3></div></div></div><p><span class="definition"><a id="def_resource_ordinary"/><span class="strong"><strong><em class="firstterm"><a id="first_resource"/><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_resource"><em class="glossterm">Resource</em></a></em></strong></span> has

                we consider it essential to determine whether the tangible resource has information

                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">about</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">representing</span>”</span> some other resource rather
                than being treated as a thing in itself. Whether a book is printed or digital, we
                focus on its information content, what it is about; its tangible properties become
                secondary. In contrast, the hangars in our closet and the measuring cups in our
                kitchen are not about anything more than their obvious utilitarian features, which
                makes their tangible properties most important. (Of course, there is no sharp
                boundary here; you can buy <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fashion hangers</span>”</span> that make a style statement, and the
                old measuring cup could be a family memento because it belonged to Grandma).</p><p><span class="definition"><a id="def_description_resources"/>Many of the resources in
                    Organizing Systems are <em class="firstterm"><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_description_resource"><em class="glossterm">description

                    search engines are familiar examples.</span> In museums, information about the
                production, discovery, or history of ownership of a resource can be more important
                than the resource; a few shards of pottery are of little value without these

                resources. Similarly, business or scientific data often cannot be understood or
                analyzed without additional information about the manner in which they were
                collected.</p><p><span>Resources that describe, or are associated with other resources are
                    sometimes called <span class="bold"><strong><em class="firstterm"><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_metadata"><em class="glossterm">metadata</em></a></em></strong></span>.</span> However, when we look
                more broadly at Organizing Systems, it is often difficult to distinguish between the
                resource being described and any description of it or associated with it. One
                challenge is that when descriptions are embedded in resources, as metadata often is
                in the title page of a book, in the masthead of a newspaper, or in the source of web
                pages, deciding which resources are primary is often arbitrary. A second challenge
                is that what serves as a metadata for one person or process can function as a
                primary resource or data for another one. Rather than being an inherent distinction,
                the difference between primary and associated resources is often just a decision
                about which resource we are focusing on in some situation. An animal specimen in a
                natural history museum might be a <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_primary_resource"><em class="glossterm">primary resource</em></a> for museum visitors and scientists interested in
                anatomy, but information about where the specimen was collected is the <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_primary_resource"><em class="glossterm">primary resource</em></a> for scientists
                interested in ecology or migration.</p><p>Organizing Systems can refer to people as resources, and we often use that term to
                avoid specifying the gender or specific role of an employee or worker, as in the
                management concept of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">human resources</span>”</span> or HR department in a firm.
                The shift from a manufacturing to an information and services economy in the last
                few decades has resulted in greater emphasis on intellectual resources represented
                in skills and knowledge rather than on the natural resources of production materials
                and physical goods.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-06" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-06" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup> It is important to consider the capabilities and motivations of the
                people who create and participate in Organizing Systems. We might discuss how human
                resources are selected, organized, and managed over time just as we might discuss
                these activities with respect to library resources. Nevertheless, these topics are
                much more appropriate for texts on human resources management and industrial
                organization so we will not consider them much further in this book.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Concept of “Collection”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-1.2.2">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Collection</span>”</span></h3></div></div></div><p><span class="definition"><a id="def_collection"/>A <span class="bold"><strong><em class="firstterm"><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_collection"><em class="glossterm">collection</em></a></em></strong></span>

                physical resources (my stamp or record album collection) as well as digital ones (my
                collection of digital music). A collection can contain identifiers for resources
                along with or instead of the resources themselves, which enables a resource to be
                part of more than one collection, like songs in playlists.</p><p>A <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_collection"><em class="glossterm">collection</em></a> itself is also a

                In particular, the concept of <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_collection"><em class="glossterm">collection</em></a> has deep roots in <span class="hardware">libraries, museums and other

                as collections of collections that are variously organized according to resource
                type, author, creator, or collector of the resources in the collection, or any

                excludes those systems from our definition of Organizing System. These
                self-organizing systems have been used in physics, chemistry, and mathematics to
                explain phase transitions and equilibrium states. Self-organizing is also used to
                describe numerous natural and man-made phenomena like climate, communication
                networks, business and biological ecosystems, traffic and habitation patterns,
                neural networks, and online communities. All of these systems involve collections of
                resources that are very large and open, with complex interactions among the
                resources. The resource arrangements that emerge cannot always be interpreted as the
                result of intentional or deterministic principles and instead are more often
                described in probabilistic or statistical terms.

                    by transforming existing collections of resources, and some combine new and
                    existing resources.</p></div><p>Taken together, the intentional arrangements of resources in an Organizing System
                are the result of decisions about what is organized, why it is organized, how much
                it is organized, when it is organized, and how or by whom it is organized (each of
                these will be discussed in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3" title="Design Decisions in Organizing Systems">Design Decisions in Organizing Systems</a>). An
                Organizing System is defined by the composite impact of the choices made on these
                design dimensions. Because these questions are interrelated their answers come
                together in an integrated way to define an Organizing System.</p><div class="sect3" title="The Concept of “Organizing Principle”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-1.2.3.1">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Organizing Principle</span>”</span></h4></div></div></div><p>The arrangements of resources in an Organizing System follow or embody one or

                        that does not assume any particular implementation or
                    realization.</span></p><p>When we organize a <span class="hardware">bookshelf</span>, <span class="hardware">home
                        office</span>, <span class="hardware">kitchen</span>, or the MP3 files on our
                        <span class="hardware">music player</span>, the resources themselves might be new and
                    modern but many of the principles that govern their organization are those that
                    have influenced the design of Organizing Systems for thousands of years. For
                    example, we organize resources using easily perceived properties to make them
                    easy to locate, we group together resources that we often use together, and we
                    make resources that we use often more accessible than those we use infrequently.
                    Very general and abstract organizing principles are sometimes called design
                    heuristics (for example, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">make things easier to find</span>”</span>). More
                    specific and commonly used organizing principles include <a id="id583656" class="indexterm"/><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_alphabetical"><em class="glossterm">alphabetical

                    resources into pre-defined categories and other organizing principles rely on
                    novel combinations of resource properties to create new categories.</p><p>Expressing organizing principles in a way that separates design and
                    implementation aligns well with the three-tier architecture familiar to software
                    architects and designers: user interface (implementation of interactions),
                    business logic (intentional arrangement), and data (resources). (See the Sidebar,
                        <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter-1-sidebar-4" title="The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems">The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems</a>).</p><p><a id="id583732" class="indexterm"/>The logical separation between organizing principles and their
                    implementation is easy to see with digital resources. In a digital library it
                    does not matter to a user if the resources are stored locally or retrieved over
                    a network. The essence of a library Organizing System emerges from the resources
                    that it organizes and the interactions with the resources that it enables. Users
                    typically care a lot about the interactions they can perform, like the kinds of
                    searching and sorting allowed by the online library catalog. How the resources
                    and interactions are implemented are typically of little concern. Similarly,
                    many email applications have migrated to the web and the system of filters and
                    folders that manage email messages is no longer implemented in a local network
                    or on personal computers, but most people neither notice nor care.</p><p>The separation of organizing principles and their implementation is harder to
                    recognize in an Organizing System that only contains <span class="hardware">physical
                        resources</span>, such as your <span class="hardware">kitchen</span> or
                        <span class="hardware">clothes closet</span>, where you appear to have unmediated
                    interactions with resources rather than accessing them through some kind of user
                    interface or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">presentation tier</span>”</span> that supports the principles
                    specified in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">middle tier</span>”</span> and realized in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">storage
                        tier.</span>”</span> Nevertheless, you can see these different tiers in the
                    organization of <span class="hardware">spices in a kitchen</span>. Different kitchens
                    might all embody an <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_alphabetical"><em class="glossterm">alphabetic
                        order</em></a> organizing principle for arranging a collection of spices,
                    but the exact locations and arrangement of the spices in any particular kitchen
                    depends on the configuration of shelves and drawers, whether a spice rack or
                    rotating tray is used, and other storage-tier considerations. Similarly, spices
                    could be logically organized by cuisine, with Indian spices separated from
                    Mexican spices, but this organizing principle does not imply anything about
                    where they can be found in the kitchen.</p><p><a id="id583866" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="chapter-1-sidebar-4"/><div class="sidebar-title">The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems</div><p>Software architects and designers agree that it is desirable to build
                        applications that separate the storage of data, the business logic or
                        functions that use the data, and the user interface or presentation
                        components through which users or other applications interact with the data.
                        This modular architecture allows each of the three tiers to be upgraded or
                        reimplemented independently to satisfy changed requirements or to take
                        advantage of new technologies. An analogous distinction is that between an
                        algorithm as a logical description of a method for solving a computational
                        problem and its implementation in a particular programming language like <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Java</span></span> or <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Python</span></span>.</p><p>These architectural distinctions are equally important to librarians and
                        information scientists. Our new way of looking at Organizing Systems
                        emphasizes the importance of identifying the desired interactions with
                        resources, determining which organizing principles can enable the
                        interactions, and then deciding how to store and manage the resources
                        according to those principles. Applying architectural thinking to Organizing
                        Systems makes it easier to compare and contrast existing ones and design new
                        ones. Separating the organizing principles in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">middle tier</span>”</span>
                        from their implications in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">data</span>”</span> and
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">presentation</span>”</span> tiers often makes it possible to implement
                        the same logical Organizing System in different environments that support
                        the same or equivalent interactions with the resources. For example, a new
                        requirement to support searching through a library catalog on a smart phone
                        would only affect the presentation tier.</p></div><p><a id="id583958" class="indexterm"/></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch01.html#chapter-1-figure-1.3.2" title="Figure 1-2. Presentation, Logic and Storage Tiers.">Figure 1-2</a> illustrates the separation of the

                    in any Organizing System directly reflect the mix of these two embodiments of
                    information; in this way we can think of the modern library as a digital
                    Organizing System that primarily relies on digital resources to organize a
                    mixture of physical and digital ones.</p><p><a id="id584094" class="indexterm"/><a id="id584102" class="indexterm"/><span class="definition"><a id="def_collocation"/>The Organizing System

                    spices in your kitchen, you do not need to alphabetize them because it is easy
                    to find the one you want.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-10" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-10" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup></p><p><span><a id="def_frequency_of_use"/>Some organization emerges implicitly through

                        clothes closet, the resources you use most often migrate to the front
                        because that is the easiest place to return them after using them.</span>
                    But as a collection grows in size, the time to arrange, locate, and retrieve a
                    particular resource becomes more important. The collection must be explicitly
                    organized to make these interactions efficient, and the organization must be
                    preserved after the interaction takes place; i.e., resources are put back in the
                    place they were found. As a result, most Organizing Systems employ organizing
                    principles that make use of properties of the resources being organized (for
                    example, name, color, shape, date of creation, semantic or biological category),
                    and multiple properties are often used simultaneously. For example, in your
                    kitchen you might arrange your <span class="hardware">cooking pots</span> and pans by
                        <span class="hardware">size and shape</span> so you can nest them and store them
                    compactly, but you might also arrange things by cuisine or style and separate
                    your grilling equipment from the wok and other items you use for making Chinese
                    food.</p><p>Unlike those for physical resources, the most useful organizing properties for
                    information resources are those based on their content and meaning, and these
                    are not directly apparent when you look at a book or document. Significant
                    intellectual effort or computation is necessary to reveal these properties when
                    assigning subject terms or creating an index. The most effective organizing
                    systems for information resources often are based on properties that emerge from
                    analyzing the collection as a whole. For example, the relevance of documents to
                    a search query is higher when they contain a higher than average frequency of
                    the query terms compared to other documents in the collection, or when they are
                    linked to relevant documents. Likewise, algorithms for classifying email
                    messages continuously recalculate the probability that words like
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">beneficiary</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Viagra</span>”</span> indicate whether a

                    <span class="hardware">animals</span> according to principles of biological taxonomy
                    or common habitat. The most important interaction supported by a modern zoo is
                    enabling visitors to <span class="action">observe</span> the behavior of animals in

                    and showcasing the animals and our own mobility limits how big a zoo can be.
                    However, this is simply a conventional manner of storing the animals and
                    supporting interactions with them.</p><p><a id="id584877" class="indexterm"/>We can imagine a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">digital zoo</span>”</span> in which all of the world’s zoos
                    are treated as a single digital collection. Instead of physical co-presence to
                    enable viewing of the animals, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">telepresence</span>”</span> quality video camera
                    connections to zoo exhibits would enable us to view animals in the San Diego,
                    Berlin, Singapore, Toronto and other great zoos from our living rooms almost as
                    if we were there. Instead of a walk from exhibit to exhibit, a tour of a digital
                    zoo would be implemented as a list of video connections, and different tours
                    implemented as different sequences of cameras. Sensors in each animal habitat
                    could detect activity and image recognition software could classify the
                    behavior, enabling us to search the combined zoo for particular combinations of
                    active animals to view (e.g., a mother and infant chimpanzee). No zoo would need
                    to change how it <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">stores</span>”</span> the animals to enable these new
                    principles of organization and our new kinds of interactions with them.</p></div><p>Some of the interactions with resources in an Organizing System are inherently
                determined by the characteristics of the resource. Because many museum resources are
                unique or extremely valuable, visitors are allowed to <span class="action">view</span> them but
                cannot <span class="action">borrow</span> them, in contrast with most of the resources in
                libraries. A library might have multiple printed copies of <em class="citetitle">Moby
                    Dick</em> but can never lend more of them than it possesses. After a
                printed book is checked out from the library, there are many types of interactions
                that might take place<span class="symbol">—</span><span class="action">reading</span>, <span class="action">translating</span>,
                <span class="action">summarizing</span>, <span class="action">annotating</span>, 
                and so on<span class="symbol">—</span>but these are not directly supported by the library
                Organizing System and are invisible to it. For works not in the public domain,

                ones. Any number of people or processes can request a weather forecast from a
                web-based weather service because the forecast is not used up by the request and the
                marginal cost of allowing another access is nearly zero. Furthermore, with digital
                resources many new kinds of interactions can be enabled through application
                software, web services, or <em class="firstterm"><a id="ref_API"/>application
                    program interfaces (<abbr class="abbrev">API</abbr>s)</em> in the
                Organizing System. In particular, translation, summarization, annotation, and
                keyword suggestion are highly useful services that are commonly supported by web
                search engines and other web applications. Similarly, an Organizing System with
                digital resources can implement a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">keep everything up to date</span>”</span>
                interaction that automatically pushes current content to your browser or computing
                device.</p><p><a id="id585082" class="indexterm"/>But just as technology can enable interactions, it can prevent or
                constrain them. If your collection of digital resources (ebooks or music, for
                example) is not stored on your own computer or device, a continuous Internet
                connection is a requirement for access. In addition, access control policies and
                    <span class="application">digital rights management (<abbr class="abbrev">DRM</abbr>)</span>
                technology can limit the devices that can access the collection and prevent copying,

                <a id="id585135" class="indexterm"/><a id="id585142" class="indexterm"/> fair use doctrine.</p><p>Just as with organizing principles, it is useful to think of interactions in an
                abstract or logical way that does not assume an implementation because it can
                encourage innovative designs for Organizing Systems.

            described or arranged to enable interactions with them. Explicitly or by default, this
            requires many interdependent decisions about the identities of resources; their names,
            descriptions and other properties; the classes, relations, structures and collections in
            which they participate; and the people or technologies who interact with them.</p><p>One important contribution of the idea of the Organizing System is that it moves
            beyond the debate about the definitions of things, documents, and information with the
            unifying concept of resource while acknowledging that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">what is being
                organized</span>”</span> is just one of the questions or dimensions that need to be
            considered.</p><p>These decisions are deeply intertwined, but it is easier to introduce them as if they
            were independent. We introduce five groups of design decisions, itemizing the most
            important dimensions in each group:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>What is being organized?</strong></span> What is the scope

                    Organizing System? Is the Organizing System being designed to enable a resource
                    collection to be created, for an existing and closed resource collection, or for
                    a collection in which resources are continually added or deleted? Are the
                    resources unique, or are they interchangeable members of a class? Do they follow

                    a centralized or top-down manner or in a distributed or bottom-up manner? What
                    organizing principles guide the organization? Are all resources organized to the

                    time, all the time? Is any of this organizing mandated by law or shaped by
                    industry practices or cultural tradition?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>How or by whom, or by what computational processes, is

            requirements and goals of its human and computational users, and on understanding the
            constraints and tradeoffs that any set of requirements and goals impose. How and when
            these constraints and tradeoffs are handled can depend on the legal, business and
            technological contexts in which the Organizing System is designed and deployed; on the
            relationship between the designers and users of the Organizing System (who may be the
            same people or different ones); on the economic or emotional or societal purpose of the
            Organizing System; and on numerous other design, deployment, and use factors.</p><div class="sect2" title="Organizing Systems in a “Design Space”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-1.3.1">Organizing Systems in a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Design Space</span>”</span></h3></div></div></div><p>Classifying Organizing Systems according to the kind of resources they contain is
                the most obvious and traditional approach. We can also classify Organizing Systems
                by their dominant purposes, by their intended user community, or other ways. No
                single fixed set of categories is sufficient by itself to capture the commonalities
                and contrasts between Organizing Systems.</p><p>We can augment the categorical view of Organizing Systems by thinking of them as
                existing in a multi-faceted or multi-dimensional design space in which we can
                consider many types of collections are at the same time.</p><div class="sect3" title="Conventional Ways to Classify Organizing Systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-1.3.1.1">Conventional Ways to Classify Organizing Systems</h4></div></div></div><p>We distinguish law libraries from software libraries, knowledge management
                    systems from data warehouses, and personal <span class="hardware">stamp
                        collections</span> from <span class="hardware">coin collections</span> primarily
                    because they contain different kinds of resources. Similarly, we distinguish
                        <span class="hardware">document collections</span> by resource type, contrasting
                    narrative document types like novels and biographies with transactional ones
                    like catalogs and invoices, with hybrid forms like textbooks and encyclopedias
                    in between.</p><p>But there are three other conventional ways to classify Organizing Systems. A
                    second way to distinguish Organizing Systems is by their dominant purposes or
                    the priority of their common purposes. For example, libraries, museums, and
                    archives are often classified as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">memory institutions</span>”</span> to emphasize
                    their primary emphasis on resource preservation. In contrast, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">management
                        information systems</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">business systems</span>”</span> are
                    categories that include the great variety of software applications that
                    implement the Organizing Systems needed to carry out day-to-day business
                    operations.</p><p>A third conventional approach for classifying Organizing Systems is according
                    to the nature or size of the intended user community. This size or scope can
                    range from personal Organizing Systems created and used by a single person; to
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">community-based</span>”</span> Organizing Systems used by informal social
                    groups; to those used by the employees, customers or stakeholders of an
                    enterprise; to those used by an entire community or nation; to global ones
                    potentially used by anyone in the world.</p><p>A fourth way to distinguish Organizing Systems is according to the technology
                    used to implement them. Large businesses use different software applications for
                    inventory management, records management, content management, knowledge
                    management, customer relationship management, data warehousing and business
                    intelligence, e-mail archiving, and other subcategories of collections.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-14" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-14" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup></p><p>We can become overwhelmed by this proliferation of ways to classify
                    collections of resources, especially when the classification is not clearly
                    based on just one of these many approaches. For example, the list of
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library types</span>”</span> used by the <span class="orgname">International Federation
                        of Library Associations</span> to organize its activities includes
                    resource-based distinctions (e.g. art libraries, law libraries, social science
                    libraries), purpose-based ones (e.g., academic and research libraries), and
                    user-based distinctions (e.g., public libraries, school libraries, libraries
                    serving persons with print disabilities).<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-15" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-15" class="footnote">15</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect3" title="A Multifaceted or Multidimensional View"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-1.3.1.2">A Multifaceted or Multidimensional View</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="id585629" class="indexterm"/>A type of resource and its conventional Organizing System are often the focal
                    point of a discipline. Category labels like library, museum, zoo, and data
                    repository have core meanings and many associated experiences and practices.
                    Specialized concepts and vocabularies often evolve to describe these. The
                    richness that follows from this complex social and cultural construction makes
                    it difficult to define category boundaries precisely. 
                    Consider Borgman’s commonly accepted definition of libraries as institutions
                    that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">select, collect, organize, conserve, preserve, and provide access to
                        information on behalf of a community of users.</span>”</span> Many Organizing
                    Systems are described as libraries, although they differ from traditional
                    libraries in important respects.

                            forever.</span>”</span> But the <span class="application">Google Books</span> project
                        was widely criticized as not being true to library principles.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-16" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-16" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup></p></div><p>We can always create new categories by stretching the conventional definitions
                    of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library</span>”</span> or other familiar Organizing Systems and adding
                    modifiers, as when <span class="application">Flickr</span> is described as a web-based
                    photo-sharing library. But whenever we define an Organizing System with respect
                    to a familiar category, the typical or mainstream instances and characteristics
                    of that category that are deeply embedded in language and culture are
                    reinforced, and those that are atypical are marginalized. In the
                        <span class="application">Flickr</span> case this means we suggest features that
                    are not there (like authoritative classification) or omit the features that are
                    distinctive (like tagging by users).</p><p>More generally, a categorical view of Organizing Systems makes it matter
                    greatly which category is used to anchor definitions or comparisons. The
                        <span class="application">Google Books</span> project makes out-of-print and
                    scholarly works vastly more accessible, but framing it in library terms to
                    suggest it is a public good upsets many people with a more traditional sense of
                    what the library category implies. We can readily identify design choices in
                        <span class="application">Google Books</span> that are more characteristic of the
                    Organizing Systems in business domains, and the project might have been
                    perceived more favorably had it been described as an online bookstore that
                    offered many beneficial services for free.</p><p>A complementary perspective on Organizing Systems is that they exist in a
                    multi-faceted or multi-dimensional design space. This <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_framework"><em class="glossterm">framework</em></a> for describing and comparing
                    Organizing Systems overcomes some of the biases and conservatism built into
                    familiar categories like libraries, museums, and archives, while enabling us to
                    describe them as design patterns that embody characteristic configurations of
                    design choices. We can then use these patterns to support multi-disciplinary
                    work that cuts across categories and applies knowledge about familiar domains to
                    unfamiliar ones. A dimensional perspective makes it easier to translate between
                    category and discipline-specific vocabularies so that people from different
                    disciplines can have mutually intelligible discussions about their organizing
                    activities. They might realize that they have much in common, and they might be
                    working on similar or even the same problems.</p><p>A faceted or dimensional perspective acknowledges the diversity of instances
                    of collection types and provides a generative, forward-looking framework for
                    describing hybrid types that do not cleanly fit into the familiar categories.
                    Even though it might differ from the conventional categories on some dimensions,
                    an Organizing System can be designed and understood by its <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">family
                        resemblance</span>”</span> on the basis of its similarities on other dimensions to
                    a familiar type of resource collection.</p><p>Thinking of Organizing Systems as points or regions in a design space makes it
                    easier to invent new or more specialized types of collections and their
                    associated interactions. If we think metaphorically of this design space as a
                    map of Organizing Systems, the empty regions or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white space</span>”</span>
                    between the densely-populated centers of the traditional categories represent
                    Organizing Systems that do not yet exist. We can consider the properties of an
                    Organizing System that could occupy that white space and analyze the technology,
                    process, or policy innovations that might be required to let us build it there.
                    Try this analogy test: <span class="application">Google Books</span> is to Library as
                    ? is to <span class="orgname">Natural History Museum</span>.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-17" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-17" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id586042" class="indexterm"/>But even though digital technology is radically subdividing the traditional
                    categories of collections by supporting new kinds of specialized
                    information-intensive applications, an opposite and somewhat paradoxical trend
                    has emerged. <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jennifer</span> <span class="surname">Trant</span></span> argues that the common challenges of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">going digital,</span>”</span>
                    and the architectural and functional constraints imposed by web implementations,
                    are causing some convergence in the operation of libraries, museums, and
                    archives. Similarly, <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Anne</span> <span class="surname">Gilliland</span></span> suggests that giving every physical resource in a collection a
                    digital surrogate or proxy that is searchable and viewable in a web browser is
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">erasing the distinctions between custodians of information and

                    traditional categories for thinking about collections are splintering in some
                    respects and converging in others, they are less useful in describing innovative
                    collections and their associated interactions.

                it. It might seem straightforward to devise an Organizing System around
                    <span class="hardware">tangible resources</span>, but we must be careful not to assume
                what a resource is. In different situations, the same thing can be treated as a
                unique item, as one of many equivalent members of a broad category, or as component
                of an item rather than as an item on its own. For example, in a museum collection, a
                    <span class="hardware">handmade carved chess piece</span> might be a separately
                identified item, identified as part of a <span class="hardware">set of carved chess
                    pieces</span>, or treated as one of the 33 unidentified components of an
                item identified as a chess set (including the board). When merchants assign a
                stock-keeping unit (<abbr class="abbrev">SKU</abbr>) to identify the things they sell, an
                    <abbr class="abbrev">SKU</abbr> can be associated with a unique item, to sets of items
                treated as equivalent for inventory or billing purposes, or to intangible things
                like warranties.</p><p>You probably do not have explicit labels on the cabinets and drawers in your
                kitchen or clothes closet, but department stores and warehouses have
                    <span class="hardware">signs</span> in the aisles and on the shelves because of the
                larger number of things a store needs to organize. As a collection of resources
                grows, it often becomes necessary to identify each one explicitly; to create
                surrogates like bibliographic records or descriptions that distinguish one resource
                from another; and to create additional organizational mechanisms like
                    <span class="hardware">shelf labels</span>, <span class="hardware">store directories</span>,
                    <span class="hardware">library card catalogs</span> and <span class="hardware">indexes</span> that
                facilitate understanding the collection and locating the resources it contains.
                These organizational mechanisms often suggest or parallel the organizing principles
                used to organize the collection itself.</p><p>Organization mechanisms like <span class="hardware">aisle signs</span>, store directories
                and library card catalogs are embedded in the same physical environment as the
                resources being organized. But when these mechanisms or surrogates are digitized,
                the new capabilities that they enable create design challenges. This is because a
                digital Organizing System can be designed and operated according to more abstract
                and less constraining principles than an Organizing System that only contains
                physical resources. A single physical resource can only be in one
                    <span class="hardware">place</span> at a time, and interactions with it are constrained
                by its <span class="hardware">size</span>, <span class="hardware">location</span>, and other
                properties. In contrast, digital copies and surrogates can exist in many places at
                once and enable searching, sorting, and other interactions with an efficiency and
                scale impossible for tangible things.</p><p>When the resources being organized consist of information content, deciding on the
                unit of organization is challenging because it might be necessary to look beyond
                physical properties and consider conceptual or intellectual equivalence. A high
                school student told to study Shakespeare’s play <em class="citetitle">Macbeth</em> might
                treat any printed copy or web version as equivalent, and might even try to outwit
                the teacher by watching a film adaptation of the play. To the student, all versions
                of <em class="citetitle">Macbeth</em> seem to be the same resource, but librarians and
                scholars make much finer distinctions.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-19" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-19" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">19</a>]</sup></p><p>Archival Organizing Systems implement a distinctive answer to the question of what
                is being organized. Archives are a type of collection that focuses on resources
                created by a particular person, organization, or institution, often during a
                particular time period. This means that archives have themselves been previously
                organized as a result of the processes that created and used them. <a id="id586391" class="indexterm"/><a id="id586497" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_fonds"/>The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">original order</span>”</span> of the

                    essential part of the meaning of the collection. As a result, the unit of
                    organization for archival collections is the <span class="strong"><strong><em class="firstterm"><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_fonds"><em class="glossterm">fonds</em></a></em></strong></span><span class="symbol">—</span>the

                    re-organized according to other (perhaps more systematic)
                    classifications.</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-20" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-20" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup></p><p>Some Organizing Systems contain legal, business or scientific documents or data
                that are the digital descendants of paper reports or records of transactions or
                observations. These Organizing Systems might need to deal with legacy information
                that still exists in paper form or in electronic formats like image scans that are
                different from the structural digital format in which more recent information is
                likely to be preserved. When legacy conversions from printed information artifacts
                are complete or unnecessary, an Organizing System no longer deals with any of the
                traditional <span class="hardware">tangible artifacts</span>. Digital libraries dispense with
                these artifacts, replacing them with the capability to print copies if needed. This
                enables libraries of digital documents or data collections to be vastly larger and
                more accessible across space and time than any library that stores tangible,
                physical items could ever be.</p><p>An increasing number of Organizing Systems handle resources that are born digital.
                Ideally, digital texts can be encoded with explicit markup that captures structural
                boundaries and content distinctions, which can be used to facilitate organization,
                retrieval, or both. In practice the digital representations of texts are often just
                image scans that do not support much processing or interaction. A similar situation
                exists for the digital representations of music, photographs, videos, and other
                non-text content like sensor data, where the digital formats are structurally and
                semantically opaque.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Why Is It Being Organized?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-1.3.3">Why Is It Being Organized?</h3></div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">The central purpose of systems for organizing information

                describe or arrange resources so they can be located and accessed later. The
                organizing principles needed to achieve this goal depend on the types of resources
                or domains being organized, and in the personal, social, or institutional setting in
                which organization takes place. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Bringing like things together</span>”</span> is an
                informal organizing principle for many Organizing Systems. But there will likely be
                a number of more precise requirements or constraints to satisfy.</p><p>Organizing Systems involving <span class="hardware">physical resources</span> are more
                likely to emphasize aesthetic or emotional goals than those for information
                resources, which more often are dominated by functional goals like
                    <span class="hardware">efficiency of storage</span> and <span class="hardware">access</span>. This
                contrast is often magnified by the tendency for major library and museum collections
                to be housed in buildings designed as architectural monuments that over time become
                symbols of national or cultural identity.</p><p><a id="id586713" class="indexterm"/>The fine distinctions between Organizing Systems that have many characteristics in
                common reflect subtle differences in the priority of their shared goals. For
                example, many Organizing Systems create collections and enable interactions with the
                goals of supporting scientific research, public education, and entertainment. We can
                contrast zoos, animal theme parks, and wild animal preserves in terms of the
                absolute and relative importance of these three goals with respect to animal
                    resources.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-21a" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-21a" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup></p><p>When individuals manage their <span class="hardware">papers</span>,

                <span class="hardware">DVDs</span>, and other information resources, their Organizing Systems
                vary greatly. This is in part because the content of the resources being organized
                becomes a consideration. Furthermore, many of the Organizing Systems used by
                individuals are implemented by web applications, and this makes them more accessible
                because their resources can be accessed from anywhere with a web browser.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-21" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-21" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup></p><p>Put another way, an information resource inherently has more potential uses than
                resources like <span class="hardware">forks</span> or <span class="hardware">frying pans</span>, so it
                is not surprising that the Organizing Systems in offices are even more diverse than
                those in <span class="hardware">kitchens</span>.</p><p>When the scale of the collection or the number of intended users increases, not
                everyone is likely to share the same goals and design preferences for the Organizing
                System. If you share a kitchen with housemates, you might have to negotiate and
                compromise on some of the decisions about how the kitchen is organized so you can
                all get along. In more formal or institutional Organizing Systems conflicts between
                stakeholders can be much more severe, and the organizing principles might even be
                specified in commercial contracts or governed by law. For example, Bowker and Star
                note that physicians view the creation of patient records as central to diagnosis
                and treatment, insurance companies think of them as evidence needed for payment and
                reimbursement, and researchers think of them as primary data. Not surprisingly,
                policymaking and regulations about patient records are highly contentious.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-22" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-22" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup></p><p>Almost as soon as libraries were invented over two thousand years ago, the

                support many functions and services other than those that directly support search
                and location of resources in their collections. In these respects, the Organizing
                Systems in non-profit libraries have much in common with those in corporate

                    place that govern information creation or capture and then manage its entire
                    life cycle. In addition to the Organizing Systems that manage and provide access
                    to their collections, large libraries also need business Organizing Systems to
                    support acquisition, billing, interlibrary loan record routing and systems,
                    licenses of digital resources from publishers, course material websites, and the
                    library’s own web presence. Commercial firms need processes for transacting with
                    customers or other firms to carry out business operations, to support research
                    and innovation, and to develop business strategy and tactics in compliance with
                    laws and regulations for accounting, taxes, human resources, data retention, and
                    so on. In large firms these functions are so highly specialized and complex that
                    the different types of Organizing Systems have distinct names: <a id="id586950" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587018" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587023" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587028" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587033" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587038" class="indexterm"/><span class="application">Enterprise Resource Planning

                    that manage the information resources needed for its business operation, these
                    firms might also need to maintain corporate libraries and archives.</p></div><p>Preserving documents in their physical or original form is the primary purpose of
                    <span class="hardware">archives</span> and similar Organizing Systems that contain
                culturally, historically, or economically significant documents that have value as
                long-term <span class="hardware">evidence</span>. Preservation is also an important
                motivation for the Organizing Systems of information- and knowledge-intensive firms.
                Businesses and governmental agencies are usually required by law to keep records of
                financial transactions, decision-making, personnel matters, and other information
                essential to business continuity, compliance with regulations and legal procedures,
                and transparency. As with archives, it is sometimes critical that these business
                knowledge or records management systems can retrieve the original documents,
                although digital copies that can be authenticated are increasingly being accepted as
                legally equivalent.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories">Chapter 7</a> more fully explains the different purposes for

                section we will briefly unpack this notion of degree of organization into three
                important and related dimensions: the amount of description or organization applied
                to each resource, the amount of organization of resources into classes or
                categories, and the overall extent to which interactions in and between organizing
                systems are shaped by resource description and arrangement. <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter 4</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a>, more thoroughly address these questions about the nature
                and extent of description in Organizing Systems.</p><p>Not all resources in a collection require the same degree of description for the
                simple reason we discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3.3" title="Why Is It Being Organized?">Why Is It Being Organized?</a>: Organizing Systems
                exist for different purposes and to support different kinds of interactions or
                functions. Let’s contrast two ends of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">degree of description</span>”</span>
                continuum. Many people use <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">current events awareness</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">news
                    feed</span>”</span> applications that select news stories whose titles or abstracts
                contain one or more keywords. This exact match algorithm is easy to implement, but
                its all-or-none and one-item-at-a-time comparison misses any stories that use
                synonyms of the keyword, that are written in languages different from that of the
                keyword, or that are otherwise relevant but do not contain the exact keyword in the
                limited part of the document that is scanned. However, users with current events
                awareness goals do not need to see every news story about some event, and this
                limited amount of description for each story and the simple method of comparing
                descriptions are sufficient.</p><p>On the other hand, this simple Organizing System is inadequate for the purpose of
                comprehensive retrieval of all documents that relate to some concept, event, or
                problem. This is a critical task for scholars, scientists, inventors, physicians,
                attorneys and similar professionals who might need to discover every relevant
                document in some domain. Instead, this type of Organizing System needs rich
                bibliographic and semantic description of each document, most likely assigned by
                professional catalogers, and probably using terms from a <em class="firstterm"><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_controlled_vocabulary"><em class="glossterm">controlled
                    vocabulary</em></a></em> to enforce consistency in what descriptions
                mean.</p><p><a id="id587236" class="indexterm"/>Similarly, different merchants or firms might make different decisions
                about the extent or granularity of description when they assign
                <abbr class="abbrev">SKU</abbr>s because of differences in suppliers, targeted customers, or
                other business strategies. If you take your car to the repair shop because
                windshield wiper fluid is leaking, you might be dismayed to find that the broken
                    <span class="hardware">rubber seal</span> that is causing the leak cannot be ordered
                separately and you have to pay to replace the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><span class="hardware">wiper fluid
                        reservoir</span></span>”</span> for which the seal is a minor but vital part.
                Likewise, when two business applications try to exchange and merge customer
                information, integration problems will arise if one describes a customer as a single
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">NAME</span>”</span> component while the other separates the customer’s name into
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">TITLE,</span>”</span> <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">FIRSTNAME,</span>”</span> and
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">LASTNAME.</span>”</span></p><p>Even when faced with the same collection of resources, people differ in how much
                organization they prefer or how much disorganization they can tolerate. A classic
                study by <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Tom</span> <span class="surname">Malone</span></span> of how people organize their office workspaces and desks contrasted
                the strategies and methods of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">filers</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pilers.</span>”</span>
                Filers maintain clean desktops and systematically organize their papers into
                categories, while pilers have messy work areas and make few attempts at
                organization. This contrast has analogues in other Organizing Systems and we can
                easily imagine what happens if a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">neat freak</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">slob</span>”</span>
                become roommates.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-23" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-23" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup></p><p>Different preferences and disagreements between stakeholders in an Organizing
                System about how much organization is necessary often result because of the
                implications for who does the work and who gets the benefits, especially the
                economic ones. Physicians prefer narrative descriptions and broad classification
                systems because they make it easier to create patient notes. In contrast, insurance
                companies and researchers want fine-grained <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">form-filling</span>”</span> descriptions
                and detailed classifications that would make the physician’s work more
                    onerous.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-24" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-24" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id587430" class="indexterm"/>The cost-effectiveness of creating systematic and comprehensive descriptions of
                the resources in an information collection has been debated for nearly two centuries
                and in the last half century the scope of the debate grew to consider the role of
                computer-generated resource descriptions.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-25" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-25" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">27</a>]</sup></p><p>An alternative and complement to man-made descriptions for each resource are
                computer-generated indexes of their textual contents. These indexes typically assign
                weights to the terms according to calculations that consider the frequency and
                distribution of the terms in both individual documents and in the collection as a
                whole to create a description of what the documents are about. These descriptions of
                the documents in the collection are more consistent than those created by human
                organizers. They allow for more complex query processing and comparison operations
                by the retrieval functions in the Organizing System. For example, query expansion
                mechanisms or thesauri can automatically add synonyms and related terms to the
                search. Additionally, retrieved documents can be arranged by relevance, while
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">citing</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cited-by</span>”</span> links can be analyzed to find
                related relevant documents.</p><p>A second constraint on the degree of organization comes from the size of the
                collection within the scope of the Organizing System. Organizing more resources
                requires more descriptions to distinguish any particular resource from the rest, and
                more constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to be grouped or
                classified to emphasize the most important distinctions among the complete set of
                resources in the collection. A small neighborhood restaurant might have a short wine
                list with just ten wines, arranged in two categories for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">red</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white</span>”</span> and described only by the wine’s name and price. In
                contrast, a gourmet restaurant might have hundreds of wines in its wine list, which
                would subdivide its <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">red</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white</span>”</span> high-level
                categories into subcategories for country, region of origin, and grape varietal. The
                description for each wine might in addition include a specific vineyard from which
                the grapes were sourced, the vintage year, ratings of the wine, and tasting
                notes.</p><p>At some point a collection grows so large that it is not economically feasible for
                people to create bibliographic descriptions or to classify each separate resource,
                unless there are so many users of the collection that their aggregated effort is
                comparably large; this is organizing by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">crowdsourcing.</span>”</span> (See the
                Sidebar on <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Web 2.0</span>”</span> in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3.6" title="How (or by Whom) Is It Organized?">How (or by Whom) Is It Organized?</a>). This leaves two approaches that can be done separately or in tandem. The
                simpler approach is to describe sets of resources or documents as a set or group,
                which is especially sensible for archives with its emphasis on the <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_fonds"><em class="glossterm">fonds</em></a> (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3.2" title="What Is Being Organized?">What Is Being Organized?</a>). The second approach is to rely on automated and more
                general-purpose organizing technologies that organize resources through
                computational means. Search engines are familiar examples of computational
                organizing technology, and <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.6" title="Computational Classification">Computational Classification</a> describes other common
                techniques in machine learning, clustering, and discriminant analysis that can be
                used to create a system of categories and to assign resources to them.</p><p><a id="id587619" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587651" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587604" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587609" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587625" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587630" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587634" class="indexterm"/>Finally, we must acknowledge the ways in which information processing and
                telecommunications technologies have transformed and will continue to transform
                Organizing Systems in every sphere of economic and intellectual activity. A century
                ago, when the telegraph and telephone enabled rapid communication and business
                coordination across large distances, these new technologies enabled the creation of
                massive vertically integrated industrial firms. In the 1920s the Ford Motor Company
                owned coal and iron mines, rubber plantations, railroads, and steel mills so it
                could manage every resource needed in automobile production and reduce the costs and
                uncertainties of finding suppliers, negotiating with them, and ensuring their
                contractual compliance. Adam’s Smith’s invisible hand of the market as an organizing
                mechanism had been replaced by the visible hand of hierarchical management to
                control what Ronald Coase in 1937 termed <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">transaction costs</span>”</span> in <a class="link" href="bi01.html#Coase1937" title="“The Nature of the Firm”"><em class="citetitle">The
                    Nature of the Firm</em></a>.</p><p><a id="id587570" class="indexterm"/><a id="id587683" class="indexterm"/>But in recent decades 
                a new set of information and computing technologies enabled
                by Moore’s Law<span class="symbol">—</span>unlimited computer power, effectively free
                bandwidth, and the Internet<span class="symbol">—</span>have turned Coase upside down,
                leading to entirely new forms of industrial organization made possible as
                transaction costs plummet. When computation and coordination costs drop
                dramatically, it becomes possible for small firms and networks of services (provided
                by people or by computational processes) to outcompete large corporations through
                more efficient use of information resources and services, and through more effective
                information exchange with suppliers and customers, much of it automated. Herbert
                Simon, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, decision making, and human-computer
                interaction, recognized the similarities between the design of computing systems and
                human organizations and developed principles and mechanisms that could apply to
                    both.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-25a" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-25a" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. The Forms of Resource Descriptions">Chapter 8</a>, focuses on the representation of resource

                computational power to analyze the contents and associated structures (like links
                between web pages) to impose organization on resources that have already been
                published or made available so that they can be retrieved in response to a user’s
                query <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">on the way out.</span>”</span> Google makes use of existing organization
                within and between information resources when it can, but its unparalleled
                technological capabilities and scale yield competitive advantage in imposing
                organization on information that was not previously organized digitally. <a id="id588080" class="indexterm"/>Indeed, <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Geoff</span> <span class="surname">Nunberg</span></span> criticized <span class="orgname">Google</span> for ignoring or undervaluing the
                descriptive metadata and classifications previously assigned by people and replacing
                them with algorithmically assigned descriptors, many of which are incorrect or
                    inappropriate.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-27" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-27" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup> One reaction to the poor quality of some computational description has
                been the call for libraries to put their authoritative bibliographic resources on
                the open web, which would enable reuse of reliable information about books, authors,
                publishers, places, and subject classifications. This <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">linked data</span>”</span> movement is
                slowly gathering momentum.<sup>[<a id="chapter-1-endnote-27a" href="#ftn.chapter-1-endnote-27a" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id588187" class="indexterm"/><a id="id588194" class="indexterm"/><a id="id588201" class="indexterm"/><a id="id588208" class="indexterm"/>
                <span class="orgname">Google</span> makes almost all of its money through personalized ad
                placement, so much of the selection and ranking of search results is determined
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">on the way out</span>”</span> in the fraction of a second after the user submits
                a query by using information about the user’s search history and current context. Of
                course, this <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">on the way out</span>”</span> organization is only possible because of
                the more generic organization that Google’s algorithms have imposed, but that only
                reminds us of how much the traditional distinction between <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">information

                as the resources governed by the Organizing System are used. The arrangement of
                resources in a kitchen or in an office changes incrementally as <span class="hardware">frequently
                    used things</span> end up in the front of the pantry, drawer, shelf or
                filing cabinet or on the top of a pile of papers. Printed books or documents acquire
                margin notes, underlining, turned down pages or coffee cup stains that differentiate
                the most important or most frequently used parts. Digital documents do not take on
                coffee cup stains, but when they are edited, their new revision dates put them at
                the top of directory listings.</p><p>The scale of emergent organization of websites, photos on

                and used online dwarfs the incremental evolution of individual Organizing Systems.
                This organization is clearly visible in the pattern of links, tags, or ratings that
                are explicitly associated with these resources, but search engines and advertisers
                also exploit the less visible organization created over time by information about

            have been essential human activities for millennia, evolving both in response to human
            needs and to enable new ones. Organizing Systems enabled the development of
            civilization, from agriculture and commerce to government and warfare. Today Organizing
            Systems are embedded in every domain of purposeful activity, including research,
            education, law, medicine, business, science, institutional memory, sociocultural memory,
            governance, public accountability, as well as in the ordinary acts of daily
            living.</p><p>With the World Wide Web and ubiquitous digital information, along with effectively unlimited
            processing, storage and communication capability, millions of people create and browse
            websites, blog, tag, tweet, and upload and download content of all media types without
            thinking <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I’m organizing now</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I’m retrieving now.</span>”</span> Writing
            a book used to mean a long period of isolated work by an author followed by the
            publishing of a completed artifact, but today some books are continuously and
            iteratively written and published through the online interactions of authors and
            readers. When people use their <span class="hardware">smart phones</span> to search the web or
            run applications, location information transmitted from their phone is used to filter
            and reorganize the information they retrieve. Arranging results to make them fit the
            user’s location is a kind of computational curation, but because it takes place quickly
            and automatically we hardly notice it.</p><p>Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly about information
            retrieval is now increasingly combined with activities and functions that most would

            information. However, these firms increasingly augment this retrieval capability with
            information services that organize information in close to real-time. Further, the
            selection and presentation of search results, advertisements, and other information can

            highlights the design dimensions and decisions that collectively determine the extent

                specialized vocabulary used to describe semantic relationships between resources and
                between the concepts and words used in resource descriptions. It also discusses the
                structural relationships within multipart resources and between resources, like

                essential human activities that take place automatically for perceptual categories

                deeply ingrained in language and culture, and we use linguistic and cultural
                categories without realizing it, but categorization can also be a deeply analytic
                and cognitive process. <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a> reviews

                            because they differ greatly in the time they take to complete and the
                            storage space they require. For example, if the collection is arranged
