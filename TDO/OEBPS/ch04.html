            assign an identifier to the stored photograph and they also capture the technical

            creation: the date, time and location on Earth where the photograph is taken. When the
            image is transferred out of the camera and is published for all to see, it might be
            useful to record biographical information about the photographer to help viewers relate

            the same thing; each boy has devised his own set of descriptive terms for the tiny

            purposes these scenarios are both about resource description. Together both scenarios
            raise important questions about describing resources that we answer in this chapter:
            What is the purpose of resource description? What resource properties should be
            described? How are resource descriptions created? What makes a good resource
            description?</p><p>We begin with an overview of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">resource description</span>”</span> (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.2" title="An Overview of Resource Description">An Overview of Resource Description</a>), which we propose as a broad concept that
            includes the narrower concepts of bibliographic descriptions and metadata. <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3" title="The Process of Describing Resources">The Process of Describing Resources</a> describes a 7-step process of describing resources that
            includes determining scope, focus and purposes, identifying resource properties,
            designing the description vocabulary, designing the description form and implementation,
            and creating and evaluating the descriptions. Because many principles and methods for
            resource description were developed for describing text resources in physical formats,
            in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.4" title="Describing Non-Text Resources">Describing Non-Text Resources</a> we briefly discuss the issues that arise when

            conversation, and they are the enablers of organizing systems.</p><div class="sect2" title="Naming {and, or, vs.} Describing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-4.2.1">Naming {and, or, vs.} Describing</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter 3</a> discussed how to decide what things should be treated
                as resources and how names and identifiers distinguish one resource from another.
                    <span>Many names are literally resource descriptions, or once were.</span>
                Among the most common surnames in English are descriptions of occupations (<span class="personname"><span class="surname">Smith</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Miller</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Taylor</span></span>), <a id="id611992" class="indexterm"/>descriptions of <a id="id611999" class="indexterm"/>kinship relations (<span class="personname"><span class="surname">Johnson</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Wilson</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Anderson</span></span>), and descriptions of appearance (<span class="personname"><span class="surname">Brown</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">White</span></span>).<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-03" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-03" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">192</a>]</sup></p><p>Similarly, many other kinds of resources have names that are <span>property

                    <span>White House</span>), geographical locations (<span>North

                    Forks</span>, <span>Baton Rouge</span>).</p><p>In many cultures throughout the world, it has been very common for one spouse or
                the other to take on a name that describes their marital relationship. Historically,
                in many parts of the English-speaking world, married women have often referred to
                themselves using their husband’s name; when <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jane</span> <span class="surname">Smith</span></span> married <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">John</span> <span class="surname">Brown</span></span>, her name became <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jane</span> <span class="surname">Brown</span></span> or <span class="personname"><span class="honorific">Mrs.</span>. <span class="firstname">John</span> <span class="surname">Brown</span></span>.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-04" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-04" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">193</a>]</sup></p><p><span>Every resource can be given a name or identifier. Identifiers are
                    especially efficient resource descriptions because, by definition, identifiers
                    are unique over some domain or collection of resources. Names and identifiers do
                    not typically describe the resource in any ordinary sense because they are
                    usually assigned to the resource rather than recording a property of
                    it.</span></p><p>However, the arbitrariness of names and identifiers means that they do not serve
                to distinguish resources for people who do not already know them. This is why we use
                what linguists call referring expressions or definite descriptions, like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the
                    small black dog</span>”</span> rather than the more efficient <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Blackie,</span>”</span>
                when we are talking to someone who does not know that is the dog’s name.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-05" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-05" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">194</a>]</sup></p><p>Similarly, when we use a library catalog or search engine to locate a known
                resource, such as a particular book or document, we query for it using its name, or
                other specific information we know about it, to increase the likelihood that we can
                find it. In contrast, when we are looking for resources to satisfy an information
                need but do not have specific resources in mind, we query for them using
                descriptions of their content or other properties. In general, information retrieval
                can be characterized as comparing the description of a user’s needs with
                descriptions of the resources that might satisfy them.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="“Description” as an Inclusive Term"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-4.2.2"><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Description</span>”</span> as an Inclusive Term</h3></div></div></div><p>Up to now we have used the concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">description</span>”</span> without defining
                it because we have most often used it in its ordinary sense to mean the visible or
                important features that characterize or represent something. However, the concept is
                sometimes used more precisely in the context of organizing systems, where resource
                description is often more formal, systematic, and institutional. <span><a id="def_descriptor"/>In the library science context of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bibliographic

                    that can be assigned to a resource to designate its properties, characteristics,
                    or meaning, or its relationships with other resources.</span> In the contexts
                of conceptual modeling and information systems design, the terms in resource
                descriptions are also called keywords, index terms, attributes, attribute values,
                elements, data elements, data values, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the vocabulary.</span>”</span> In contexts
                where descriptions are less formal or more personal the description terms are often
                called labels or tags. Rather than attempt to make fine distinctions among these
                synonyms or near-synonyms, we will use <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">description</span>”</span> as an inclusive
                term except where conventional usage overwhelmingly favors one of the other
                terms.</p><p>All of these terms come from a relatively narrow semantic scope in which the
                purpose of description is to identify and characterize the essence, or <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_aboutness"><em class="glossterm">aboutness</em></a>, of a resource. This leaves out
                many kinds of information that can be associated with a resource to support
                additional purposes; for example, information that specifies access controls or
                possible uses of the resource, or information about actual uses. We will describe
                many of these purposes and the types of information needed to enable them in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.2" title="Determining the Purposes">Determining the Purposes</a>, and we use <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">resource description</span>”</span> in an
                expansive way to accommodate all of them.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter 3</a> introduced the distinction of <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.2.4" title="Resource Focus">Resource Focus</a> to contrast primary resources with
                resources that describe them, which we called Description Resources. We chose this
                term as a more inclusive and more easily understood alternative to two terms that
                are well established in organizing systems for information resources: <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_bibliographic_description"><em class="glossterm">bibliographic

                        includes not just the information resources being described as distinct
                        instances, but also as sets of related instances and the nature of those

                    as a structured record in a standardized format that describes a specific
                    resource. The earliest bibliographic records in the nineteenth century were
                    those in book catalogs, which organized for each author a list of his authored
                    books, with separate entries for each edition and physical copy. Relationships
                    between books by different authors were described using cross-references.</p><p>The nature and extent of bibliographic descriptions were highly constrained by
                    the <span class="hardware">book catalog</span> format, which also made the process of
                    description a highly localized one because every library or collection of
                    resources created its own catalog. The adoption of <span class="hardware">printed
                        cards</span> as the unit of organization for bibliographic descriptions
                    around the turn of the twentieth century made it easier to maintain the catalog,

                    descriptions had been created according to cataloging rules designed for

                    in the 1970s, so it is much newer than that of bibliographic description. In
                    addition, metadata has originally meant and still most often refers to
                    descriptions of classes or collections of resources rather than descriptions of
                    individual resources. The earliest metadata resources, called data dictionaries,
                    documented the arrangement and content of data fields in the records used by
                    transactional applications on mainframe computers. A more sophisticated type of
                    metadata emerged as the documentation of the data models in database management
                    systems, called database schemas, which described the structure of relational
                    tables, attribute names, and legal data types and values for content.</p><p><a id="id612768" class="indexterm"/>In 1986, the <em class="firstterm"><a id="first_SGML"/><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle"><em class="citetitle">Standard Generalized Markup

                focuses on each individual description or assertion about a single resource. This

                the choice of syntax in which the descriptions are encoded.</p><p>Both of these implementation decisions have important implications, but are

                metadata that reflects the historical emphasis on bibliographic description, in
                contrast to our view that treats resource description as a more inclusive category.
                In addition, these classifications do not always distinguish between intrinsic and

                    technology used to create, edit, store, and retrieve them.</p></li><li class="step" title="Creating the Descriptions"><p class="title"><strong>Creating the Descriptions</strong></p><p>Resource descriptions are created by individuals, by informal or formal groups
                    of people, or by automated or computational means. Some types of descriptions
                    can only be created by people, some types of descriptions can only be created by
                    automated or algorithmic techniques, and some can be created in either
                    manner.</p></li><li class="step" title="Evaluating the Descriptions"><p class="title"><strong>Evaluating the Descriptions</strong></p><p>The resource descriptions must be evaluated with respect to their intended
                    purposes. The results of this evaluation will help determine which or the
                    preceding steps need to be redone.</p></li></ol></div><p>The next seven sub-sections discuss each of these steps in detail. A quick reference
            guide is <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#chapter-4-figure-4.3" title="Figure 4-3. The Process of Describing Resources.">Figure 4-3</a></p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a id="chapter-4-figure-4.3"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figs/print/ch4.3-350dpi.png" alt="The process of describing resources consists of seven steps: &#10;                        Determining the scope and focus, determining the purpose, identifying resource properties, &#10;                        designing the description vocabulary, designing the description form and implementation, &#10;                        creating the descriptions, and evaluating the descriptions."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 4-3. The Process of Describing Resources.</div></div></div><p>How explicit and systematic each step needs to be depends on the resource domain and
            scope, and especially on the intended users of the organizing system. If we look
            carefully, we can see most of these steps taking place even in very informal contexts,
            like the kids playing with Lego blocks with which we started this chapter. The goal of
            building things with the blocks leads the boys to identify which properties are most
            useful to analyze. They develop descriptions of the blocks that capture the specific
            values of the relevant properties. Finally, they evaluate their descriptions by using
            them when they play together; it becomes immediately obvious that a description is not
            serving its purpose when one boy hands a block to another that was not the one he
            thought he had asked for.</p><p>In contrast, the picture-taking scenario involves a much more explicit and systematic
            process of resource description. The resource properties, description vocabulary, and
            description form used automatically by the digital camera were chosen by an industry
            association and published as a technical specification implemented by camera and mobile
            phone manufacturers worldwide. If a professional photographer is taking the photo for
            commercial purposes, many of the other descriptions assigned to the image to identify
            ownership, rights management and syndication are likely to conform to formal
            specifications and be managed in institutional information systems.</p><p>The resource descriptions used by libraries, archives, and museums are typically
            created in an even more explicit and systematic manner. Like the descriptions of the
            digital photo, the properties, vocabulary, and form of the descriptions used by their
            organizing systems are governed by standards. However, there is no equivalent to the
            digital camera that can create these descriptions automatically. Instead, highly trained
            professionals create them meticulously.</p><p>A great many resources and their associated descriptions in business and scientific
            organizing systems are created by automated or computational processes, so the process
            of describing individual resources is not at all like that in libraries and other memory
            institutions. However, the process for designing the data models or schemas for the
            class of resources that will be generated is equally systematic and is typically
            performed by highly skilled data analysts and data modelers.</p><div class="sect2" title="Determining the Scope and Focus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-4.3.1">Determining the Scope and Focus</h3></div></div></div><p>Which resources do we want to describe? As we saw in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter 3</a>, determining what will be treated as a separate resource is
                not always easy, especially for resources with component parts and for information
                resources where the most important property is their content, which is not directly
                perceivable. Identifying the thing you want to describe as precisely as practical is
                the first step to creating a useful description.</p><p><a id="id614484" class="indexterm"/>In <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.2.4" title="Resource Focus">Resource Focus</a>, we introduced the contrast between primary
                resources and description resources, which we called resource focus. Determining the
                resource focus goes hand in hand with determining which resources we intend to
                describe; these often arbitrary decisions then make a huge difference in the nature
                and extent of resource description. One person’s metadata is another person’s data.
                For a librarian, the price of a <span class="hardware">book</span> might be just one more
                attribute that is part of the book’s record. For an accountant at a bookstore, the
                price of that book<span class="symbol">—</span>both the cost to buy the book and the
                price at which it is then sold to customers<span class="symbol">—</span>is critical
                information for staying in business. A scientist studying comparative anatomy
                preserves <span class="hardware">animal specimens</span> and records detailed
                    <span class="hardware">physical descriptions</span> about them, but a scientist studying
                ecology or migration discards the specimens and focuses on describing the context in
                which the specimen was located.</p><div class="sect3" title="Describing Instances or Describing Collections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.1.1">Describing Instances or Describing Collections</h4></div></div></div><p>It is simplest to think of a resource description as being associated with
                    another individual resource. However, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter 3</a>, it can be challenging to determine what to treat as an
                    individual resource when resources are themselves objects or systems that are
                    composed of other parts or resources. For example, we sometimes describe a
                    football team as a single resource and at other times we focus on each
                    individual player. However, after we have decided on resource granularity, the
                    question remains whether each resource needs a separate description.</p><p>Libraries and museums specialize in curating resource descriptions about the
                    instances in their collections. Resource descriptions are also applied to
                    classes or collections of resources (because a collection is also a resource;
                    see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.2.2" title="The Concept of “Collection”">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Collection</span>”</span></a>). Archives and <span class="hardware">special collections
                        of maps</span> are typically assigned resource descriptions, but each
                    document or map contained in the collection does not necessarily have its own
                    bibliographic description. Similarly, business and scientific data sets are
                    invariably described at collection-level granularity because they are often
                    analyzed in their entirety.</p><p>Furthermore, the granularity of description for a collection of resources
                    tends to differ for different users or purposes. Consider the information
                    systems that commodity traders use to access descriptions of real
                        <span class="hardware">resources in markets</span> all over the world: some traders
                    are concerned with weekly production in their region, while others are
                    monitoring real-time global flows of <span class="hardware">precious metals</span> and
                        <span class="hardware">petroleum products</span>. Many web pages, especially
                    e-commerce product catalogs and news sites, are dynamically assembled and
                    personalized from a large number of information resources and services that are
                    separately identified and described in content management and content delivery
                    systems. However, a highly complex collection of resources that comes together
                    in a single page is treated as a single resource when that page appears in a
                    list of search engine results. Moreover, all of the thousands of separately
                    generated pages can be given a single description when a user creates a bookmark
                    to make it easy to return to the home page of the site.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Abstraction in Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.1.2">Abstraction in Resource Description</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="id614629" class="indexterm"/>We can also associate resource descriptions with an entire type or
                    domain of resources (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.5.2.4" title="Preserving Resource Types">Preserving Resource Types</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.2.1" title="Resource Domain">Resource Domain</a>). A collection of resource descriptions is vastly
                    more useful when every resource is described using common description elements
                    or terms that apply to every resource. <a id="id614715" class="indexterm"/><a id="id614716" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_schema"/>A <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_schema"><em class="glossterm">schema</em></a> (or model, or metadata standard) specifies the set
                        of descriptions that apply to an entire resource type.</span> Sometimes
                    this schema, model, or standard is inferred from or imposed on a collection of
                    existing resources to ensure more consistent definitions, but more often, it is
                    used as a specification when the resources are created or generated in the first
                    place (See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#chapter-2-sidebar-1" title="What about “Creating” Resources?">What about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Creating</span>”</span> Resources?</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.1" title="Introduction">Introduction</a>).</p><p>A <span class="application">relational database</span>, for example, is easily
                    conceptualized as a collection of records organized as one or more tables, with
                    each record in its own row having a number of fields or attributes that contain
                    some prescribed type of content. Each record or row in the database table is a
                    description of a resource<span class="symbol">—</span>an employee, a product,
                    anything<span class="symbol">—</span>and the individual attribute values, organized
                    by the columns and rows of the table, are distinct parts of the description for
                    some particular resource instance, like employee 24 or product 8012C.</p><p><a id="id614800" class="indexterm"/>Because the relational database schema serves as a model for the creation of
                    resource descriptions, it is designed to restrict the descriptions to be simple
                    and completely regular sets of attribute-value pairs. The database schema
                    specifies the overall structure of the tables and especially their columns,
                    which will contain the attribute values that describe each resource. An employee
                    table might have columns for the attributes of employee ID, hiring date,
                    department, and salary. A date attribute will be restricted to a value that is a
                    date, while an employee salary will be restricted according to salary ranges
                    established by the human resources department. This makes the name of the
                    attribute and the constraints on attribute values into resource descriptions
                    that apply to the entire class of resources described by the table.</p><p>The information resources that we commonly call documents are, by their
                    nature, less homogeneous in content and structure than those that can be managed
                    in databases. Document schemas, commonly represented in <abbr class="abbrev">SGML</abbr> or
                        <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr>, usually allow for a mixture of data-like and textual
                    descriptive elements. <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> schema languages have greatly
                    improved on <abbr class="abbrev">SGML</abbr> and <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> by expressing the
                    description of the document schema in <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> itself, using the
                    same syntax as the resource it describes, making it easy to create resources
                    using the metadata as a template or pattern. As a result, <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr>
                    schemas are often used as the specifications for <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> resources
                    created and used by information-intensive applications; in this context, they
                    are often called <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> vocabularies. <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> schemas
                    are often used to define web forms that capture resource instances (each
                    filled-out form). <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> schemas are also used to describe the
                    interfaces to web services and other computational resources.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-18" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-18" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">207</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id614868" class="indexterm"/>It is often necessary to associate some descriptions with individual
                    resources that are specific to that instance and other kinds of descriptions
                    that reflect the abstract class to which the instance belongs. When <span class="hardware">a
                        typical car</span> comes off the assembly line, it has only one
                    instance-level description that differentiates it from its peers: its
                        <span class="hardware">vehicle identification number</span> (<abbr class="abbrev">VIN</abbr>).
                    Specific cars have individualized interior and exterior colors and installed
                    options, and they all have a date and location of manufacture. Other description
                    elements have values that are shared with many other cars of the same model and
                    year, like suggested price and the additional option packages, or configurations
                    that can be applied to it before it is delivered to a customer. Alternatively,
                    any descriptive information that applies to multiple cars of the same model year
                    could be part of a resource description at that level that is referred to rather
                    than duplicated in instance descriptions.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Scope, Scale, and Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.1.3">Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</h4></div></div></div><p>If we only had one thing to describe, we could use a single word to describe
                    it: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">it.</span>”</span> We would not need to distinguish it from anything else. A
                    second resource implies at least one more term in the description language:
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">not it.</span>”</span> However, as a collection grows, descriptions must
                    become more complex to distinguish not only between, but also among
                    resources.</p><p>Every element or term in a description language creates a dimension, or axis,
                    along which resources can be distinguished, or it defines a set of questions
                    about resources. Distinctions and questions that arise frequently, such as
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">what is the name of the resource?</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">who created
                        it?</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">what type of content or matter does it
                        contain?</span>”</span>, need to be easy to address. Therefore, as a collection
                    grows, the language for describing resources must become more rigorous, and
                    descriptions created when the collection was small often require revision
                    because they are no longer adequate for their intended purposes. The description
                    language typically evolves from a simple list of descriptive terms to a glossary
                    with definitions, to a highly controlled vocabulary with content rules for
                    allowable values, and, finally, to a thesaurus in which each term is also
                    defined with respect to its semantic relationships to other terms that are
                    broader, narrower, or otherwise associated with it.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-19" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-19" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">208</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id615089" class="indexterm"/>This co-evolution of descriptive scope and description complexity is easy to
                    see in the highly complex bibliographic descriptions created by professional
                    catalogers. <a id="id615094" class="indexterm"/> The commonly used <em class="firstterm"><abbr class="abbrev">AACR2</abbr></em>
                    cataloging standards distinguish 11 different categories of resources and

                    standardized at national and international levels, cataloging work is
                    distributed among many describers whose results are shared. This principle of
                    standardization has been the basis of centralized bibliographic description for
                    a century.</p><p>Centralized resource description by skilled professionals works for libraries,
                    but even in the earliest days of the web many library scientists and web
                    authoring futurists recognized that this approach would not scale for describing
                    web resources. In 1995, the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Dublin Core</span></span> metadata element set with only 15 elements was proposed as a
                    vastly simpler description vocabulary that people not trained as professional
                    catalogers could use.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-21" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-21" class="footnote">210</a>]</sup> Since then, the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Dublin Core</span></span> initiative has been highly influential in inspiring numerous
                    other communities to create minimalist description vocabularies, often by
                    simplifying vocabularies that had been devised by professionals for use by
                    non-professionals. In this respect, we can also view the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Dublin Core</span></span> as part of the intellectual foundations for the
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">crowdsourcing</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">community curation</span>”</span> of

                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">composer</span>”</span> and many other descriptions of the person or non-human
                    resource responsible for the intellectual content of a resource with just
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">creator</span>”</span> results in a substantial loss of precision when the
                    description is created and can cause misunderstanding when the descriptions are
                        reused.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-22" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-22" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">211</a>]</sup></p><p>The negative impacts of growing scope and scale on resource description can
                    sometimes be avoided if the ultimate scope and scale of the organizing system is
                    contemplated when it is being created. It would not be smart for a business with
                    customers in six US states to create an address field in its customer database
                    that only handled those six states; a more extensible design would allow for any
                    state or province and include a country code. In general, however, just as there
                    are problems in adapting a simple vocabulary as scope and scale increase,
                    designing and applying resource descriptions that will work for a large and

                    summarization, visualization, transformation, reuse, mixing, remixing... far too
                    many purposes to list here. The core principle that underlies all of these
                    purposes is that the variety and functions of the interactions with digital
                    resources depends on the richness of their structural, semantic, and format
                    description (See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.2.2" title="Value Creation with Digital Resources">Value Creation with Digital Resources</a>).</p><p>An important difference between interactions with <span class="hardware">physical
                        resources</span> and those with digital resources is how they use
                    resource descriptions for access control. Resources sometimes have associated
                    security classifications like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Top Secret</span>”</span> that restrict who can
                    learn about their existence or obtain them. Nonetheless, if you get your hands
                    on a <span class="hardware">top secret printed document</span>, nothing can prevent you
                    from reading it. Similarly, <span class="hardware">printed resources</span> often have
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">All rights reserved</span>”</span> copyright notices that say that you
                    cannot copy them, but nothing can prevent you from making copies with a
                        <span class="hardware">copy machine</span>. On the other hand, learning of the
                    existence of a digital resource might be of little value if copyright or
                    licensing restrictions prevent you from obtaining it. Moreover, obtaining a
                    digital resource might be of no value if its content is only available using a
                    password, decryption key, or other resource description that enforces access
                    control directly rather than indirectly like the security
                    classifications.</p><p>Another important difference between <span class="hardware">physical resources</span>
                    and digital ones is that interactions with the latter are easily recorded. Usage
                    records from session logs, browsing, or downloading activities are resource
                    descriptions that can be tied to payments for using the resources or analyzed to
                    influence the selection and organizing of resources in future
                    interactions.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Resource Description to Support Maintenance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.2.4">Resource Description to Support Maintenance</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="id617042" class="indexterm"/><a id="id617031" class="indexterm"/>Many types of resource descriptions that support selection (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.2.1" title="Resource Description to Support Selection">Resource Description to Support Selection</a>) are also useful over time to support
                    maintenance of specific resource and the collection to which they belong. In
                    particular, technical information about resource formats and technology
                    (software, <span class="hardware">computers</span>, or other) needed to use the
                    resources, and information needed to ensure resource integrity is often called
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">preservation metadata</span>”</span> in a maintenance context.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-33" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-33" class="footnote">222</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id617114" class="indexterm"/><a id="id617120" class="indexterm"/><a id="id617126" class="indexterm"/>Other types of resource descriptions more exclusively associated
                    with maintenance activities include version information and effectivity or
                    useful life information. Usage records are also valuable because they enable the
                    identification of resources that are not being accessed, suggesting that they
                    are no longer needed and can thus be safely archived or discarded.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Identifying Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-4.3.3">Identifying Properties</h3></div></div></div><p>Once the purposes of description have been established, we need to identify the
                specific properties of the resources that can satisfy those purposes. There are four
                reasons why this task is more difficult than it initially appears.</p><p>First, any particular resource might need many resource descriptions, all of which
                relate to different properties, depending on the interactions to be supported and
                the context in which they take place. Think about how we might describe
                    <span class="hardware">something as simple as a chair</span>. In your house, you might
                describe your chair based on the room it is in, e.g., <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the kitchen
                    chair.</span>”</span> When you take the same chair to a potluck dinner at a friend’s
                house, where all the chairs end up in the kitchen, it becomes <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">my
                    chair,</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the wooden chair,</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the folding
                    chair,</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the black chair with white trim.</span>”</span> Maybe you
                inherited it, so when you talk to your family, you call it <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">grandma’s
                    chair.</span>”</span> If you decide to sell it, you will describe it in a way that is
                intended to encourage someone to buy it, as an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">all-oak antique kitchen chair
                    in mint condition.</span>”</span></p><p><a id="id617289" class="indexterm"/>Second, different types of resources need to incorporate different
                properties in their descriptions. For resources in a museum, these might include
                    <span class="hardware">materials</span> and dimensions of <span class="hardware">pieces of
                    art</span>; for files and services managed by a network administrator, these
                include access control permissions; for electronic books or
                    <span class="hardware">DVDs</span>, they would include the digital rights management
                    (<abbr class="abbrev">DRM</abbr>) code that expresses what you can and cannot do with the
                resource.</p><p>Third, as we briefly touched on in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.1.3" title="Scope, Scale, and Resource Description">Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</a>, which
                properties participate in resource descriptions depends on who is doing the
                describing. It makes little sense to expect fine-grained distinctions and
                interpretations about properties from people who lack training in the discipline of
                organizing. We will return to this tradeoff in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.6" title="Creating Resource Descriptions">Creating Resource Descriptions</a> and
                again in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.4.1" title="Describing Museum and Artistic Resources">Describing Museum and Artistic Resources</a>.</p><p>Fourth, what might seem to be the same property at a conceptual level might be
                very different at an implementation level. Many types of resources have a resource
                description that is a surrogate or summary in some respects of the primary resource.
                For <span class="hardware">photos</span>, <span class="hardware">paintings</span>, and other resources
                whose appearance is their essence, an appropriate summary description can be a
                smaller, reduced resolution or thumbnail photo of the original. This surrogate is
                simple to create and it is easy for users to understand its relationship to the
                primary resource. On the other hand, distilling a text down to a short summary or
                abstract is a skill unto itself. Time-based resources provide greater challenges for
                summary. Should the summary of a movie be a textual summary of the plot, a
                significant clip from the movie, a video summary, or something else altogether? How
                is a song summarized? Or a poem? Or a tree?</p><p>Two important dimensions for understanding and contrasting resource properties
                used in descriptions and organizing principles 
                are property essence<span class="symbol">—</span>whether the properties are intrinsically or
                extrinsically associated with the resource, 
                and property persistence<span class="symbol">—</span>the properties are static or dynamic. Taken together
                these two dimensions yield four categories of properties, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#chapter-4-sec4.3.3" title="Figure 4-4. Property Essence x Persistence: Four Categories of Properties.">Figure 4-4</a></p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a id="chapter-4-sec4.3.3"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figs/print/ch4.4-350dpi.png" alt="The distinctions of property persistence and property essence are orthogonal &#10;                        so they can be combined to distinguish four categories of properties: &#10;                        intrinsic static ones, extrinsic static ones, intrinsic dynamic ones, and extrinsic dynamic ones."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 4-4. Property Essence x Persistence: Four Categories of Properties.</div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Intrinsic Static Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.3.1">Intrinsic Static Properties</h4></div></div></div><p>Intrinsic or implicit properties are inherent in the resource and can often be
                    directly perceived or experienced. Static properties do not change their values
                    over time. The size, color, shape, weight, material of composition, and texture
                    of natural or manufactured objects are intrinsic and static properties that are
                    often used to describe and organize physical resources. If a particular Lego is
                    blue, it is set apart from all the not-blue Legos; a square Lego is physically
                    different from a round one. When bibliographic resources were exclusively
                    physical, their sizes and their number of pages were common physical properties
                    in their descriptions.</p><p>Intrinsic physical properties are usually just part of resource descriptions.
                    In many cases, physical properties describe only the surface layer of a
                    resource, revealing little about what something is or its original intended
                    purpose, what it means, or when and why it was created. These intrinsic static
                    properties cannot be directly perceived. The author or creator of a resource,
                    the context of its creation, and the duration of a song are other examples of
                    intrinsic and static resource properties.</p><p>Intrinsic descriptions are often extracted or calculated by computational
                    processes. For example, a computer program might calculate the frequency and
                    distribution of words in some particular document. Those statistics about
                    content properties would still be intrinsic descriptions even though an external
                    process creates them. Similarly, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">image signatures</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">audio
                        fingerprints</span>”</span> are intrinsic descriptions (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.4" title="Describing Non-Text Resources">Describing Non-Text Resources</a>).</p><p>Some relationships among resources are intrinsic and static, like the
                    parent-child relationship or the sibling relationship between two children with
                    the same parents. Part-whole or compositional relationships for resources with
                    parts, both physical ones like manufactured objects and digital ones like
                    hierarchical documents or databases, are also intrinsic static properties often
                    used in resource descriptions. However, it is better to avoid treating resource
                    relationships as properties, and instead express them as relations. <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Describing Relationships and Structures">Chapter 5</a> discusses part-whole and other semantic relationships
                    in great detail.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Extrinsic Static Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.3.2">Extrinsic Static Properties</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="id617546" class="indexterm"/><a id="id617560" class="indexterm"/>Extrinsic or explicit properties are assigned to a resource rather than being
                    inherent in it. The name or identifier of a resource is often arbitrary but once
                    assigned does not usually change. Arranging resources according to the
                    alphabetical or numerical order of their descriptive identifiers is a common
                    organizing principle. Classification numbers and subject headings assigned to
                    bibliographic resources are extrinsic static properties, as are the serial
                    numbers stamped on or attached to manufactured products.</p><p>For information resources that have a digital form, the properties of their
                    printed or rendered versions might not be intrinsic. Some text formats
                    completely separate content from presentation, and as a result, style sheets can
                    radically change the appearance of a printed document or web page without
                    altering the primary resource in any way. For example, were a different style
                    applied to this paragraph to highlight it in bold or cast in 24-point font, its
                    content would remain the same.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Intrinsic Dynamic Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.3.3">Intrinsic Dynamic Properties</h4></div></div></div><p>Intrinsic dynamic properties change over time, such as developmental personal
                    characteristics like a person’s height and weight, skill proficiency, or
                    intellectual capacity. Because these properties are not static, they are usually
                    employed only to organize resources whose membership in the collection is of
                    limited duration. Sports programs or leagues that segregate participants by age
                    or years of experience are using intrinsic dynamic properties to describe and
                    organize the resources.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Extrinsic Dynamic Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.3.4">Extrinsic Dynamic Properties</h4></div></div></div><p>Extrinsic dynamic properties are in many ways arbitrary and can change because
                    they are based on usage, behavior, or context. The current owner or location of
                    a resource, its frequency of access, the joint frequency of access with other
                    resources, its current popularity or cultural salience, or its competitive
                    advantage over alternative resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic
                    properties that are used in resource descriptions. A topical book described as a
                    best seller one year might be found in the discount sales bin a few years later.
                    A student’s grade point average is an extrinsic dynamic property.</p><p>Many relationships between resources are extrinsic and dynamic properties,
                    like that of best friend.</p><p>Resources are often described with <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_cultural_properties"><em class="glossterm">cultural properties</em></a></strong></span> that derive from
                    conventional language or culture, often by analogy, because they can be highly
                    evocative and memorable.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-34" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-34" class="footnote">223</a>]</sup> For the <span class="hardware">Lego</span> boys familiar with the

                    the obvious word for a long, neon tube with a handle. However, someone who has
                    never seen or heard of <em class="citetitle">Star Wars</em> would not understand
                    this description, and he would describe the piece some other way. Sometimes a
                    cultural description lasts longer than its salience, so it loses its power to
                    evoke anything other than puzzlement about what it might mean.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-35" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-35" class="footnote">224</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id617731" class="indexterm"/><a id="id617716" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_contextual_properties"/><span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_contextual_properties"><em class="glossterm">Contextual

                    resource description. Similarly, any particular link from one web page to
                    another is an extrinsic static description, but because many web pages
                    themselves are highly dynamic, we can also consider links as dynamic as well.

                    implementing any principle requires many additional and specific
                    context-dependent choices for which the general principle offers little
                    guidance. For example, how does the principle of Standardization apply if
                    multiple standards already exist in some resource domain? Which of the competing
                    standards should be adopted, and why? The second challenge is that the general
                    principles can sometimes lead to conflicting advice. The User Convenience
                    recommendation to choose description terms in common use fails if the user
                    community includes both ordinary people and scientists who use different terms
                    for the same resources; whose <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">common usage</span>”</span> should prevail?</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Who Uses the Descriptions?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.4.2">Who Uses the Descriptions?</h4></div></div></div><p>Focus on the user of the descriptions. This is a core idea that we cannot
                    overemphasize because it is implicit in every step of the process of resource
                    description. All of the design principles in the previous section share the idea
                    that the design of the description vocabulary should focus on the user of the
                    descriptions. Are the resources being organized personal ones, for personal and
                    mostly private purposes? In that case, the description properties and terms can
                    be highly personal or idiosyncratic and still follow the design
                    principles.</p><p>Similarly, when resource users share relevant knowledge, or are in a context
                    where they can communicate and negotiate, if necessary, to identify the
                    resources, their resource descriptions can afford to be less precise and
                    rigorous than they might otherwise need to be. This helps explain the curious
                    descriptions in the <span class="hardware">Lego</span> story with which we began this
                    chapter. The boys playing with the blocks were talking to each other with the
                        <span class="hardware">Legos</span> in front of them. If they had not been able to
                    see the blocks the others were talking about, or if they had to describe their
                    toys to someone who had never played with <span class="hardware">Legos</span> before,
                    their descriptions would have been quite different.</p><p>More often, however, resource descriptions can not assume this degree of
                    shared context and must be designed for user categories rather than individual
                    users: library users searching for books, business employees or customers using
                    part and product catalogs, scientists analyzing the datasets from experiments or
                    simulations. In each of these situations resource descriptions will need to be
                    understood by people who did not create them, so the design of the description
                    vocabulary needs to be more deliberate and systematic to ensure that its terms
                    are unambiguous and sufficient to ensure reliable context-free interpretation. A
                    single individual seldom has the breadth of domain knowledge and experience with
                    users needed to devise a description vocabulary that can satisfy diverse users
                    with diverse purposes. Instead, many people working together typically develop
                    the required description vocabulary. We call the results institutional
                    vocabularies, to contrast them with individual or cultural ones (We will discuss
                    this contrast more fully in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a>).</p><p>Some resource descriptions are designed to be used by computers or other
                    machines, which seemingly reduces the importance of design principles that
                    consider user preferences or common uses. However, the Standardization and
                    Integration principles become more important for inter-machine communication
                    because they enable efficient processing, reuse of data and software, and
                    increased interoperability between organizing systems.<sup>[<a id="chapter-4-endnote-38" href="#ftn.chapter-4-endnote-38" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">227</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-4.3.4.3">Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="id618361" class="indexterm"/>As we defined in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.4.3.2" title="Use Controlled Vocabularies">Use Controlled Vocabularies</a>, a <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_controlled_vocabulary"><em class="glossterm">controlled vocabulary</em></a></strong></span> is a fixed or closed set

                    instead of the vocabulary that people would otherwise use. For example, instead

                    other terms; an ontology expresses the conceptual relationships among the terms
                    in a formal logic-based language so they can be processed by computers. We will

                        because they also limit the possible values that can be used in
                        descriptions. Instead of specifying a fixed set of values, content rules
                        typically restrict descriptions by requiring them to be of a particular data
                        type (integer, Boolean, Date, and so on).</span> Possible values are
                    constrained by logical expressions (e.g., a value must be between 0 and 99) or

                    uncontrolled vocabulary, but sometimes it is a new set of invented terms. This
                    might sound odd until we consider that the goal of a controlled vocabulary is to
                    reduce the number of descriptive terms assignable to a resource. Stated this way
                    the problem is one of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dimensionality reduction,</span>”</span>
                    transforming a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one. Reducing the
                    number of components in a multidimensional description can be accomplished by
                    many different statistical techniques that go by names like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">feature

                    but they all have the same simple concept at their core. What they do is analyze
                    the correlations between resource descriptions to transform a large set into a
                    much smaller set of uncorrelated ones. In a way this implements the principle of
                    Sufficiency and Necessity we mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.4.1" title="Principles of Good Description">Principles of Good Description</a>
                    because it eliminates description dimensions or properties that do not
                    contribute much to distinguishing the resources.</p><p>Here is an oversimplified example that illustrates the idea. Suppose we have a
                    collection of resources, and every resource described as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">big</span>”</span> is
                    also described as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">red,</span>”</span> and every <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">small</span>”</span> resource is
                    also <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">green.</span>”</span> This perfect correlation between color and size means
                    that either of these properties is sufficient to distinguish <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">big
                        red</span>”</span> things from <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">small green</span>”</span> ones, and we do not need
                    clever algorithms to figure that out. But if we have thousands of properties and
                    the correlations are only partial, we need the sophisticated statistical
                    approaches to choose the optimal set of description properties and terms, and in
                    some techniques the dimensions that remain are called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">latent</span>”</span> or
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">synthetic</span>”</span> ones because they are statistically optimal but do
                    not map directly to resource properties.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Designing the Description Form"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-4.3.5">Designing the Description Form</h3></div></div></div><p>By this step in the process of resource description we have made numerous
                important decisions about which resources to describe, the purposes for which we are
                describing, them, and the properties and terms we will use in the descriptions. As
                much as possible we have described the steps at a conceptual level and postponed
                discussion of implementation considerations about the notation, syntax, and
                deployment of the resource descriptions separately or in packages. Separating design
                from implementation concerns is an idealization of the process of resource
                description, but is easier to learn and think about resource description and
                organizing systems if we do. We discuss these implementation issues in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. The Forms of Resource Descriptions">Chapter 8</a>.</p><p>Sometimes we have to confront legacy technology, existing or potential business
                relationships, regulations, standards conformance, performance requirements, or
                other factors that have implications for how resource descriptions must or should be
                implemented, stored, and managed. We will take this more pragmatic perspective in

                aspects from each in hybrid approaches. For example, the vocabulary for a new

                    description requires judgment on the tagger’s part. Most people can agree on the
                    length of a particular music file but they may differ wildly when it comes to
                    determining to which musical genre that file belongs. <a id="id619388" class="indexterm"/>Fortunately most web users implicitly recognize that the potential

                    applications will be greater if they avoid egocentric descriptions. In addition,
                    the statistics of large sample sizes inevitably leads to some agreement in
                    descriptions on the most popular applications because idiosyncratic descriptions
                    are dominated in the frequency distribution by the more conventional

                    constructed retroactively. The downside, however, is that the automated
                    description does not capture the meaning or purpose of the photo. The automated
                    description might contain information about time and place, but not that people

                    resource description generalizes to resource domains outside of the traditional

                You could write out the lyrics, but describing the music itself requires a different
                approach. A DJ, for example, might care greatly about the beats per minute in each

                        clips can not only be used to gather plays for highlight reels and specials
                        but can also be monetized by pointing out when key advertisers’ products
                        appear on film. Currently, labeling the video requires a person to watch the
                        scenes and tag elements of each frame, but once those tags have been created
                        and sequenced along with the video, they can be more easily searched in

                        to create descriptions of location is the <span class="application">NextBus</span>
                        transportation tracking service in San Francisco, which tells transit riders
                        exactly when <span class="hardware">vehicles</span> will be arriving at particular
                        stops. NextBus uses <span class="hardware">sensors</span> to track the
                            <span class="hardware">GPS</span> coordinates of <span class="hardware">buses and
                            trains</span>, then compares that to route and information from
                        transportation providers and estimates the time it will take for a
                            <span class="hardware">vehicle</span> to arrive at some selected location. To
                        offer information that will be useful to riders, NextBus must figure out how
                        to describe the location of a <span class="hardware">vehicle</span> and the distance
                        between that location and some intended target, as well as creating
                        descriptions of transit routes (name, number, and/or direction of travel)
                        and particular stops along the route. In some areas, NextBus incorporates
                        multiple descriptors for a given stop by allowing users to search by route,
                        by location, or by an ID number assigned to the stop.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
