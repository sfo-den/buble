        organize our physical and intellectual worlds for over two thousand years. We owe a great
        general obligation to all of them, so we dedicated this book to them. However, it is more
        important to acknowledge more specifically the people who made this <em class="citetitle">Discipline of Organizing</em>
        book happen. I think it is befitting of a book about organizing to be organized in making
        these acknowledgments, as follows in three categories:</p><h2><a id="id674845"/>The Motivators</h2><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Annalee</span> <span class="surname">Saxenian</span></span>, 
        the Dean of the <span class="orgname">UC Berkeley School of Information</span>, challenged me in 2005
        to teach the “Information Organization and Retrieval” course required of all entering
        graduate students and provided me with a supportive environment in which to do it. The lecture notes
        of my predecessors, Berkeley colleagues <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Marti</span> <span class="surname">Hearst</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Ray</span> <span class="surname">Larson</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Mark</span> <span class="surname">Davis</span></span>, provided
        important intellectual scaffolding as I developed my own syllabus and lectures.</p><p>When I discovered the little red book by 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Elaine</span> <span class="surname">Svenonius</span></span>, 
        <em class="citetitle">The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization</em>, 
        my mind opened up to library and information science. I
        aspired to write a book that could build on and broaden those foundations to connect with my
        own background in cognitive and computer science.  A few months later when I met Elaine I was very pleased when she endorsed this ambitious effort.</p><p>I have been continually encouraged by faculty members and deans whenever I talked about
        this project at Schools of Information or similar academic units. These include the U.S.
        universities of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and North Carolina, Canadian universities
        of Toronto and Western Ontario, and European universities in Vienna and Berlin. In
        particular, I would like to thank

        I especially appreciate the encouragement that Deans Marchionini and Seadle
        gave to 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Ryan</span> <span class="surname">Shaw</span></span> and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Vivien</span> <span class="surname">Petras</span></span>, 
        two of the principal authors of this book. I apologize
        to those of you that I’ve forgotten to list here.</p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Margy</span> <span class="surname">Avery</span></span> 
        of <span class="orgname">The MIT Press</span> has pushed hard when she needed to and has been very receptive
        when I needed her to be.</p><h2><a id="id675084"/>The Contributors</h2><p>It took me four years of teaching the IO &amp; IR course at Berkeley before I knew enough
        (or too little) to think I could put together a book that might replace the diverse set of
        textbooks that course was using. I did not realize at the time how much I was learning from
        these teaching assistants, and I thank them for not making it obvious to me. Later on, after
        the book project was underway, my teaching assistants were invaluable in pointing out
        problems with the book, often proposing their solutions as well.</p><p>Almost exactly three years ago the project to write this book began in a graduate seminar
        whose goals were to define the topical coverage and structure of the book, and then to write
        chapters starting with my course lecture notes. Among the courageous students in that
        seminar were many authors of the book being published here: 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Rachelle</span> <span class="surname">Annechino</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">J.J.M.</span> <span class="surname">Ekaterin</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Ryan</span> <span class="surname">Greenberg</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jess</span> <span class="surname">Hemerly</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Michael</span> <span class="surname">Manoochehri</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Sean</span> <span class="surname">Marimpietri</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Kimra</span> <span class="surname">McPherson</span></span>,

        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Dan</span> <span class="surname">Turner</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Longhao</span> <span class="surname">Wang</span></span>. 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Nick</span> <span class="surname">Doty</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Mohit</span> <span class="surname">Gupta</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Erin</span> <span class="surname">Knight</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Joyce</span> <span class="surname">Tsai</span></span> 
        also contributed during this start-up period.</p><p>In Spring 2011 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Erik</span> <span class="surname">Wilde</span></span> and I conducted a seminar titled “Principles and Patterns of
        Organizing Systems” to refine the key concepts of the evolving book. This seminar added
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Brendan</span> <span class="surname">Curran</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Krishna</span> <span class="surname">Janakiraman</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Julian</span> <span class="surname">Limon</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Rowyn</span> <span class="surname">McDonald</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Elisa</span> <span class="surname">Oreglia</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Monica</span> <span class="surname">Rosenberg</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Karen</span> <span class="surname">Rustad</span></span>,

        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Leslie</span> <span class="surname">Tom</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Anne</span> <span class="surname">Wootton</span></span> to the growing set of
        student contributors. Leslie gets credit for the book’s title.</p><p>In Spring 2012 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Andrea</span> <span class="surname">Angquist</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jacob</span> <span class="surname">Portnoff</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Brian</span> <span class="surname">Rea</span></span>, supervised capably by 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Anne</span> <span class="surname">Wootton</span></span>, 
        were essential editorial assistants in my end-to-end effort to rewrite the drafts
        of Chapters 1-7 to improve their conceptual integration and continuity.</p><p>I used draft chapters of the book in my IO &amp; IR course three times, beginning in Fall
        2010. The final version of the book in 2013 barely resembles those early drafts, which means
        that many students suffered to improve the book. But they didn’t suffer passively. Many
        students submitted problems with the Twitter hashtag #tdofix, and submitted examples using
        #tdoexample, which benefited the book greatly but which surely confused their regular
        Twitter followers.</p><p>Many other Berkeley students did important work on the book. 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jen</span> <span class="surname">Wang</span></span> 
        designed the cover;
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Divya</span> <span class="surname">Anand</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Ajeeta</span> <span class="surname">Dhole</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Christina</span> <span class="surname">Pham</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Raymon</span> <span class="surname">Sutedjo-The</span></span> did the illustrations;
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Lisa</span> <span class="surname">Jervis</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Shohei</span> <span class="surname">Narron</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Anne</span> <span class="surname">Wootton</span></span> 
        worked on the extensive bibliography. A group
        of students whose work does not appear in the printed book but whose efforts will be
        revealed in future ebooks include 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Luis</span> <span class="surname">Aguilar</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Fred</span> <span class="surname">Chasen</span></span>,

        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jake</span> <span class="surname">Hartnell</span></span>,
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Eliot</span> <span class="surname">Nahman</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">AJ</span> <span class="surname">Renold</span></span>. </p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Eliot</span> <span class="surname">Kimber</span></span> 
        showed me that it was possible to write a book that could be published
        simultaneously in print and in ebooks. It hasn’t turned out to be as simple as someone as
        talented as Kimber can make it seem, but I am grateful to Eliot for convincing me that I
        should try to do it. With help from 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Bob</span> <span class="surname">Stayton</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Adam</span> <span class="surname">Witmer</span></span> 
        (and <span class="orgname">O’Reilly Publishing</span>) we will get there.</p><p>I must also thank 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Christine</span> <span class="surname">Borgman</span></span> 
        of <span class="orgname">UCLA</span> for bringing a group of energetic and
        thoughtful UCLA graduate students into the project. Two of them, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Matt</span> <span class="surname">Mayernik</span></span> and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Alberto</span> <span class="surname">Pepe</span></span>, 
        are contributing authors. 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Amelia</span> <span class="surname">Acker</span></span>, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jillian</span> <span class="surname">Wallis</span></span>, and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Laura</span> <span class="surname">Wynholds</span></span> taught me a
        great deal about libraries and archives, and I am certain they tried to teach me much more
        than I was able to learn.</p><p>Many people read draft chapters and were thankfully unsparing in their criticism because
        they wanted to make this book as good as it could be. Thank you 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Scott</span> <span class="surname">Abel</span></span>,

        and everyone else whom I have carelessly forgotten.</p><p>Few books have been as battle tested before they went to print as this one. Let me thank
        those who have been willing to teach from a book that did not entirely exist:

        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Kimra</span> <span class="surname">McPherson</span></span> 
        joined the project in the “first crusade” of Spring 2010,
        worked tirelessly through that summer to make chapter drafts course-worthy, and served as
        teaching assistants in Fall 2010 when the book was first tested with students. They helped
        me believe that there might be a book in there somewhere when it took a lot of faith to see
        that.</p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Erik</span> <span class="surname">Wilde</span></span> 
        taught me much through our multi-year collaboration and dialectic when he was
        on the Berkeley faculty from 2006-2011. Erik made me understand the elegance and great scope
        of the word “resource,” which became the central concept in this book. His meticulously
        annotated reviews of many chapters from a computer science perspective helped inspire the
        idea of discipline-tagged endnotes.</p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Ryan</span> <span class="surname">Shaw</span></span> and 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Vivien</span> <span class="surname">Petras</span></span>, 
        both young professors at schools a long distance from
        Berkeley, found courage in themselves and had confidence in the draft book coming out of
        Berkeley in 2011<span class="symbol">—</span>first to teach with it, and then to help write it, becoming the primary
        reviewers of my chapters and the first authors of Chapters 8 and 9. </p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Murray</span> <span class="surname">Maloney</span></span> joined the project in April 2012 as copy editor, but we together soon
        recognized that his nearly three decades of <abbr class="abbrev">SGML</abbr>, <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr>, 
        and publishing experience were too
        valuable not to exploit further for the benefit of this book. Without Murray’s work as the
        markup and production editor, indexer and glossary-maker, there would be too much work left
        to do and no one capable of doing it as well as Murray has. Somehow along the way he also
        found time to make important intellectual contributions as a co-author to Chapters 5 and
        8.</p><p>Finally, I want to thank 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Pam</span> <span class="surname">Samuelson</span></span>. 
        She has been far too patient with me as I talked
        with her, to her, and at her for three years while this book was being written, who turned
        many quarter-baked ideas into half-baked ones, and who turned many half-baked ones into
        cornerstones of this book. Most importantly, she has helped me focus on this book and get it
        finished when it would have been easy to give up on it. I promise not to take on another
        book project anytime soon because Pam has suffered enough for this one.</p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Robert</span> <span class="othername">J.</span> <span class="surname">Glushko</span></span>, 31 December 2012</p></section></body></html>
