It is more than a textbook<span class="symbol">—</span>it defines and
        creates the field for which it is a text. Befitting a book that lays out a discipline of
        organization that spans print and digital media, this volume is carefully organized, with a
        focus on future print and digital editions.</p><p><em class="citetitle">The Discipline of Organizing</em> has a broad scope. Even more valuable
        is its depth, the result of years of examining and thinking through related concepts<span class="symbol">—</span>often
        overlapping but not identical<span class="symbol">—</span>from the fields of library science, information science,
        business, and computer science. The rare combination of breadth and depth empowers readers
        by providing a new perspective and framework for organizing subsequent experiences. The
        organization is comprehensive and systematic, but it is not simple. A lot of concepts must
        be assimilated. Yet thanks to the authors’ thoroughness, you can proceed confident that
        investing the time to master novel concepts will pay off, that a coherent structure is being
        assembled, without inconsistencies or confusions. Into this framework you can fit your own
        examples, alongside the many provided by the authors. You can identify extensions and form
        new associations, building on a strong foundation.</p><p>The authors ask us to step back and adopt a general, multidisciplinary perspective. This
        is unusual for a textbook. For good reason, the world is marked by increasing
        specialization, the division of labor on which complex civilization depends. First we master
        a discipline; then we are encouraged to be multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and
        transdisciplinary<span class="symbol">—</span>to balance our specialized pursuits. But scholars thrive within single
        disciplines, and even in fields created as multidisciplinary efforts, such as the
        neurosciences or cognitive science, most researchers soon become highly specialized. So why
        should a student of information undertake to master this broad perspective?</p><p>By growing from insignificance to centrality in the century-old field of information
        management in a few decades, digital technology has forced a disciplinary merger. Library
        science, information science, computer science or informatics, and information systems have
        developed different terminologies and sets of abstractions. Rather than asking each camp to
        learn the others’ languages, the authors ask each of us to engage with a new terminology and
        set of abstractions.</p><p>The analogy of the artificial language Esperanto may come to mind, but we are in a better
        position. Esperanto is only useful if you are in a community of Esperantists. The
        abstractions in this book will be useful if others share them, but any reader will benefit
        by understanding the correspondences across the approaches to information organization that
        we encounter today. Unlike Esperanto, which is just another language, the concepts in this
        book reveal linkages and dependencies that we would not otherwise appreciate. The book
        provides a deep foundation for understanding changes that affect our lives and will do so
        more in the years ahead, a foundation that you will carry even if much of the time you
        converse in the language of one or another professional tribe.</p><p>Why do I say the timing is perfect, that this effort is worthwhile today? Haven’t people
        gotten by without it until now? The answer has two parts. One, which is important even if
        you have heard it before, is that this is a time of extraordinary change in our uses of
        information. The other is that people have not always <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">gotten by</span>”</span> very well; years have been
        wasted and careers damaged by not understanding the principles in this book. The likelihood
        of such wreckage is growing, as the waves of change are larger and come at us faster. On the
        positive side, the waves offer tremendous opportunity for accomplishment. The coming era of
        monster waves may be risky if we surf with a narrow focus, but thrilling for those whose
        view extends up and down the shoreline. I believe that if you read this book, you will see
        this point and be glad you read it. Let me know.</p><p><a id="id580278" class="indexterm"/>We are used to hearing about <span>Moore’s law</span> and related legislation, but familiarity lowers
        our guard.  Human beings do not reason well about exponential growth, our experience is
        linear, not exponential. What we overlook is that exponential growth can proceed for a long
        time under the radar<span class="symbol">—</span>one grain of rice, two grains, four grains, etc., not adding up to
        much, but when it reaches the point of having an impact, the impact comes so fast that we
        are unprepared for it. Decades passed before accessible digital technology could support
        high-quality photography, but when the time came, film photography disappeared so quickly
        that most major companies went bankrupt. Digital audio and video were a long time coming,
        then panicked and shuttered major industries. The expanding capacity and diminishing cost of
        information storage alter the balances described in this book. Bandwidth, increasing more
        slowly, is also reaching disruptive levels. This book provides the best tools available for
        understanding the disruptions of today and tomorrow in information management.</p><p>This perspective is invaluable now. It would have been useful earlier, but it was not
        considered imperative for the disciplines of library science, information science,
        informatics, and information systems. Historically they prospered despite interacting less
        than one might have expected. Library and information science, rooted in the humanities,
        focused technology efforts primarily on administrators and specialized users. Delivering
        services to the public was secondary. In contrast, academic computer science and
        human-computer interaction focused on widespread applications.</p><p>This book consciously connects fields that have focused on aspects of information
        organization and management such as archiving, records management, and curation, to
        information retrieval and related aspects of informatics. It explores how related issues
        play out in different contexts. The authors are admirably positive. They do not drag us
        through the myriad disasters that resulted when library and information science did not
        understand the potential contributions of digital technology and the equally unfortunate
        disasters that resulted when technologists ignored a century of work on information
        organization.</p><p>However, I will sound a cautionary note about what might go wrong if you do not understand
        the principles laid out in this book. First, for computer scientists and engineers: Major
        system-building efforts foundered due to a lack of insight into the principles of
        information organization. I will describe an early one, whose protagonists, good or bad,
        right or wrong, are all equal now.</p><p>Although not a computer scientist or computer engineer, 
        <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Vannevar</span> <span class="surname">Bush</span></span> had as much
        influence on the field as anyone through his work on shaping government support for research
        after the Second World War and through his 1945 <span class="italic">The Atlantic</span>
        essay “<span class="citetitle">As We May Think</span>”. 
        Discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter 2</a>, this essay describes a hypothetical machine
        called the Memex that would enable information retrieval through a complex <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">associative
            memory</span>”</span> that supports links much like those found in the World Wide Web today. Although
        Bush’s design was based on microfilm and optical scanning rather than silicon, his vision
        has inspired countless researchers to this day.</p><p>Less well known are Bush’s classified efforts from the 1930s through early 1950s to build
        machines for the military and information agencies with Memex capabilities. Meticulously
        detailed by historian Colin Burke in the book <em class="citetitle">Information and
            Secrecy: Vannevar Bush, Ultra, and the other Memex</em>, these projects consumed
        massive funding, occupied many brilliant MIT scientists for years, and produced nothing
        useful. A working machine was finally produced, but Bush never consulted with library
        science scholars who understood information organization from decades of work and made naïve
        assumptions about how information could be organized for retrieval<span class="symbol">—</span>the extraordinarily
        expensive machine was not usable in the real world.</p><p>Computer scientists interested in information should adopt a broad perspective, and this
        book is a place to begin. Several fields of computer science garner attention today, such as
        machine learning, data mining, information visualization, and design. Those centered on
        information, which is most directly affected by Moore’s law, are likely to have the greatest
        impact. </p><p>The library and information science side of the bridge also have seen disarray and
        disaster. Pride in a century of disciplinary development led to inertia. Once exponential
        silicon-based change could not be avoided, there was not enough time to react. Major library
        schools closed. Today there are schools of information and a range of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library and
        information science</span>”</span> schools, some more forward-looking than others. Curriculum change has
        been relatively ad hoc, shaped by local personnel and context. Consider Information to be a
        large new volcanic cone pushing up in the midst of other peaks. No consistent approach has
        emerged to navigate the range. This book provides bridges where before there were slippery
        trails.</p><p>What can you do by virtue of reading and studying this book? Most importantly, perhaps,
        you can avoid confusion<span class="symbol">—</span>when reading something or talking with someone from a different
        discipline, when asked a question in a job interview or by a colleague with a different
        background. Knowing that differences in terminology and abstractions are possible, you can
        ask questions and home quickly in on understanding. I have written elsewhere that through my
        career, such confusions frequently arose when I interacted with people in diverse
        disciplines, such as management information systems, software engineering, human factors,
        and so on. Because there was no book like this to clarify, it took me years to comprehend
        the source of many communication problems.</p><p>Beyond that, this book provides a foundation and framework for organizing and thinking
        about your experiences. This is a textbook, pointing to areas for research, providing ways
        of looking at new developments, and revealing to the perceptive reader yet unexplored
        territory in the spaces between disciplines. 
        This is a book to read and put on the bookshelf<span class="symbol">—</span>or
         in a folder in your digital reader<span class="symbol">—</span>to reread in a few years’ time.</p><p><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Jonathan</span> <span class="surname">Grudin</span></span>, 17 December 2012</p></section></body></html>
