            attention on the third main activity we outlined in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter 2</a>:
            designing resource-based interactions. What kinds of interactions do we encounter and
            what interactions are needed in <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_organizing_system"><em class="glossterm">Organizing
                Systems</em></a>?</p><p>The interactions necessary to select, describe, and organize resources were discussed
            in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter 2</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter 4</a>, and <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a> and we do not
            need to consider them again in this chapter. Furthermore, while it is crucial to
            understand all interactions that are possible within an organizing system context, this
            chapter will concentrate on interactions that are purposefully designed into them rather
            than those that arise naturally from the affordances of the resources (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.1" title="Affordance and Capability">Affordance and Capability</a>).</p><p>Implementing designed interactions depends on a careful analysis of requirements and
            resource properties. More interactions might make a system more capable, but not always,
            and they might make it more complicated to maintain. For example, if a library provides
            an access interaction for users by giving them direct access to the stacks, it is not
            necessary to provide personnel to retrieve the books for users, but books might get lost
            or misplaced. <a id="id661752" class="indexterm"/> In other words, it is important to consider the tradeoffs that arise from
            any interaction you might implement.</p><p>Initially, we will look at several organizing system environments and some of their
            main designed interactions. Although resources and their descriptions might be
            different, it turns out that similar interactions occur 
            in every organizing system<span class="symbol">—</span>just in different implementations.</p><div class="sect2" title="Interactions in Libraries"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-9.1.1">Interactions in Libraries</h3></div></div></div><p><span>The main interaction supported by most libraries is
                        <span class="action">borrowing</span>.</span> Library resources are checked out by
                their users; i.e., books are accessed and taken from the library by patrons.
                Libraries buy and describe books so that they can be found by patrons and borrowed.
                When you need to find a book on a certain topic, by a certain author, or with a
                certain title, you access the resource descriptions in the library catalog to search
                for resources that satisfy your requirement. You then access the resource directly,
                or ask a librarian to retrieve the resource for you. A <span class="action">check-out</span>
                interaction leaves a record of the resource identifier, the borrower identifier, and
                the <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_effectivity"><em class="glossterm">effectivity</em></a> dates of the loan.</p><p>Library catalogs offer a <span class="action">search</span> interaction to enable queries
                about particular fields in resource descriptions like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">author</span>”</span> or
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">title.</span>”</span> Finding a description record for a book in a library
                catalog usually means that the book is owned by the library and that it can be
                borrowed.</p><p><a id="id661803" class="indexterm"/>A much more powerful search interaction is enabled by a union catalog
                (e.g., <abbr class="abbrev">OCLC’s</abbr>
                <span class="application">Worldcat</span>), where resource descriptions from multiple
                libraries are merged before they are offered for search. Union catalogs allow
                patrons to find out with a single search whether a resource is available from any
                library that is accessible to them.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-01" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-01" class="footnote">495</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Interactions in Museums"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-9.1.2">Interactions in Museums</h3></div></div></div><p>In contrast to libraries, visitors to museums interact with resources mostly
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>to look</em></span> at them rather than by borrowing them. Museums
                enable people to discover or experience resources by <span class="emphasis"><em>exhibiting</em></span>
                artifacts in creative contexts. When museums implement this interaction in a
                website, visitors are not only able to discover what is presented to them by the
                museum curators; they can also interact with resources in new ways. Virtual
                collections enable patrons who are unable to visit remote museums to search and view
                their resources. Patrons who intend to visit museums can direct their searches to
                locate resources that are not currently on view.</p><p><a id="id661913" class="indexterm"/>The digitization of museum resources also allows visitors to experience
                them from a perspective that might not be possible in a physical museum. For

                needed. The most important interactions in the <span class="orgname">Walmart</span> organizing

                most important interactions involve moving and combining digital resource

                resources or resource descriptions<span class="symbol">—</span>whether physically or
                digitally<span class="symbol">—</span>are fundamental interactions that occur in almost
                every organizing system. Combining resources or resource descriptions poses numerous
                strategy, design and implementation challenges as producers often use different
                identifiers, descriptions or cataloging formats and practices for similar resources.
                Different service providers use different technologies, have different information
                policies, and follow different processes developed in their organizing systems. Some
                partners can exert power and determine description standards (e.g.
                    <span class="orgname">Walmart</span>), others have to adapt to whatever their counterparts
                develop (e.g. <span class="orgname">Shopstyle</span>), and still others choose to abide by
                what a standard-setting body decides.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-07" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-07" class="footnote">501</a>]</sup> Elsewhere, a laborious democratic process has to be started in order to
                align organizing practices and interactions (e.g. museums and libraries).</p><p>How can these differences be handled in order to provide seamless interactions
                within and across organizing systems? Which requirements have to be met in order to
                provide the interactions that are desired? How are different interaction types
                implemented? Finally, how can the quality of interactions be evaluated with respect
                to their requirements? These are the main questions for interactions that we will
                try to answer.</p><p>This chapter concentrates on the processes that develop interactions based on
                leveraging the resources of organizing systems in order to provide valuable services
                to their users (human or computational agents). It will discuss the determination of
                the appropriate interactions, the organization of resources for interactions, the
                implementation of interactions, and their evaluation and adaptation. Although the
                fundamental questions pertain to all types of organizing systems, this chapter
                focuses on systems that use computers to satisfy their goals.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Determining Interactions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-9.2">Determining Interactions</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="id662522" class="indexterm"/>Creating a strategy for successfully implementing interactions involves an intricate
            balance between the resources, the organizing system that arranges and manages them, its
            producers, and its intended users or consumers. The design of interactions is driven by
            user requirements and their impact on the choices made in the implementation process. It
            is constrained by resource and technical system properties and by social and legal
            requirements. Determining the scope and scale of interactions needs a careful analysis
            of these individual factors, their combination, and the consequences thereof. It is
            useful to distinguish decisions that involve choices, where multiple feasible
            alternatives exist, from decisions that involve constraints, where design choices have
            been eliminated or rendered infeasible by previous ones. The goal when creating an
            organizing system is to make design decisions that preserve subsequent choices or that
            create constraints that impose design decisions that would have been preferred
            anyway.</p><p><a id="id662535" class="indexterm"/><abbr class="abbrev">FRBR</abbr> and <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Svenonius</span></span> define five universal purposes for organizing systems:

            criteria (e.g., a stated information need in a query, predetermined categories, a
            distinguishing criterion or other formal criteria such as licensing). To increase the
            scope or precision of access, a frequent prerequisite interaction step is the
                <span class="action">integration</span>, <span class="action">joining</span>, <span class="action">clustering</span>
            or <span class="action">merging</span> of resources to provide a wider range of resources and more
            homogeneous descriptions to search.</p><p><a id="id662534" class="indexterm"/>Interactions can be distinguished by user requirements, which layer of resource
            properties is used, and the legal, social, and organizational environment. All impose
            constraints on the type of interactions that can be offered by an organizing
            system.</p><div class="sect2" title="User Requirements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-9.2.1">User Requirements</h3></div></div></div><p>Users (<span class="hardware">human</span> or computational agents) <span class="action">search</span>

                the interaction.</p><p><span>An organizing system should <span class="action">enable interactions</span> that

                requirements can be stated or implied, depending on the sophistication and
                functional capabilities of the system.</p><p>In a closet, which is a personal organizing system for <span class="hardware">physical
                    resources</span>, the person searching with an intent to find a particular
                shirt might think, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Where’s my yellow <span class="hardware">Hawaiian
                    shirt</span>?</span>”</span> but does not need to communicate the search criteria
                to anyone else in an explicit way. In a business or institutional organizing system,
                however, the user needs to describe the desired resource and interact with the
                system to select from candidate resources. This interaction might involve a
                    <span class="hardware">human intermediary</span> like a <span class="hardware">sales person</span>
                or a <span class="hardware">reference librarian</span>, or a computational one like a

                expressed.</p><p>A user’s information need usually determines the kind and content of resources
                required. User information needs are most often expressed in search queries
                (whatever is typed into a search box) or manifest themselves in the selection of one
                or more of the system categories that are offered for browsing. Queries can be as
                simple as a few keywords or very complex and specialized, employing different search
                fields or operators; they may even be expressed in a query language by expert users.
                Techniques like <span class="action">spelling correction</span>, <span class="action">query
                    expansion</span> and <span class="action">suggestion</span> assist users in

                    navigation</span> and <span class="action">faceted filtering</span> assist users in
                browsing an organizing system’s category system. Some systems allow the query to be
                expressed in natural language and then transform it into a description that is
                easier for the system to process. Queries for non-textual information like photos or
                videos are typically expressed as text, but some systems compute descriptions from
                non-textual queries such as images or audio files. For example, a user can hum a
                tune and the system will <span class="action">transform</span> it to locate the desired audio
                    recording.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-08" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-08" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">502</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id662876" class="indexterm"/>While search queries are explicitly stated user information needs, organizing
                systems increasingly attempt to solicit the user’s context or larger work task in
                order to provide more suitable or precise interactions. Factors such as level of
                education, physical disabilities, location, time, or deadline pressure often specify
                and constrain the types of resources needed as well as the types of interactions the
                user is willing or able to engage in. Using mostly implicit information collected

                    automatic tools to create these alignments become vital in ensuring their
                    accuracy and robustness. Graphical mapping tools provide users with a graphical

                    bookings for hotel and transportation, as well as desirable destinations and
                    their various offerings. We somehow reconcile the different descriptions used in
                    each of the systems and match these against each other so that the relevant
                    information can be combined and compared. Even though the systems use different
                    formats, vocabularies and structures, they are targeted toward human users and
                    are relatively easy to interpret. For automatic run-time transformations, which
                    need to be handled computationally, designers face the challenge of creating
                    more structured processes for merging information from different

                    description systems vary in expressive power and complexity, challenges to
                    transformations may arise from differences in semantic definitions, in rules
                    regarding whether an element is required or requires multiple values, in
                    hierarchical or value constraints, and in controlled vocabularies.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-31" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-31" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">525</a>]</sup> As a result of these complexities, absolute transformations that
                    ensure exact mappings will result in a loss of precision if the source
                    description system is substantially richer than the target system.</p><p>In practice, relative crosswalks where all elements in a source description
                    are mapped to at least one target regardless of semantic equivalence are often
                    implemented. This lowers the quality and <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_accuracy"><em class="glossterm">accuracy</em></a> of the mapping and can result in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">down

                    granularity or abstraction levels, transformations from different organizing
                    systems usually result in less granular or specific resource descriptions.
                    Consequently, whereas some interactions are now enabled (e.g. cross-organizing
                    system search), others that were once possible can no longer be
                    supported.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Implementing Interactions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-9.4">Implementing Interactions</h2></div></div></div><p>Whether a desired interaction can be implemented depends on the layers of resource
            properties that have been incorporated into the organizing system. How an interaction is
            implemented (especially in digital organizing systems) depends also on the algorithms
            and technologies available to access the resources or resource descriptions. Most
            implementations of resource-based interactions depend on three basic actions:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="action">Comparing resources</span></span></dt><dd><p>A core step in any interaction is to compare a user requirement
                            (usually a stated or implied information need) or a given resource with
                            the descriptions of other available resources, resulting in exact
                            matches or some measurable similarity. Resources whose descriptions are
                            similar to the description of an information need can be the output of a
                            search interaction; similar resources to a given resource can be the
                            output of a clustering or a classification interaction.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="action">Ranking</span> or <span class="action">sorting resources</span></span></dt><dd><p>Determining the similarity of resources is often not enough to satisfy
                            the goal of an interaction. Another important step is therefore to rank
                            or sort the selected resources according to particular criteria
                            determined in the interaction. Ranking resources according to their
                            relevance for a query is a typical interaction step in a ranking-based
                            search system. Sorting resources by update frequency is a typical step
                            for a push-based recommender system.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="action">Locating resources</span></span></dt><dd><p>Sometimes only resource descriptions are compared or ranked, so
                            another step is then required to locate or retrieve the resource from
                            its storage location. This could mean retrieving the Hawaiian shirt that
                            you want to wear from your closet or locating the address of a retailer
                            that sells a resource. In a digital library context, the full text of a
                            textual resource or the complete digital representation of an image
                            might be located in a local or remote repository.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Understanding resource-based interactions as combinations of comparing, ranking and
            locating steps provides us with a unifying framework, in which we can easily see what
            different interactions have in common, while also making it easier to see how they
            differ.</p><p>Some might find it useful to distinguish primary interactions from ancillary
            interactions, that is, interactions that follow another interaction. For example, one
            can only annotate a resource after it has been retrieved (searched and located) from an
            organizing system. However, in the context of this book, we will consider all
            interactions similarly as a combination of actions. Ancillary interactions can then be
            interpreted as interactions based on a series of grouped actions that by themselves
            represent more basic interactions.</p><p>The next sections describe some common interactions in digital organizing systems. One
            way to distinguish among them is to consider the source of the algorithms that are used
            in order to perform them. We can mostly distinguish <span>information retrieval
                interactions</span> (e.g., search and browse), <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_machine_learning"><em class="glossterm">machine learning</em></a> interactions (e.g.,
            cluster, classify, extract) or <span>natural language processing interactions</span>
            (e.g., named entity recognition, summarization, sentiment analysis, anaphoric
            resolution). Another way to distinguish among interactions is to note whether resources
            are changed during the interaction (e.g., annotate, tag, rate, comment) or unchanged
            (search, cluster). Yet another way would be to distinguish interactions based on their
            absolute and relative complexity, i.e., on the progression of actions or steps that are
            needed to complete the interaction. Here, we will distinguish interactions based on the
            different resource description layers they act upon.</p><p>Retrieval interactions can be found in any organizing system. Search is probably the
            most common form of access in an organizing system. When looking through your closet to
            find a particular Hawaiian shirt, you perform a retrieval interaction, albeit without
            computational tools to support the interaction. Information retrieval interactions
            perform a combination of comparing, ranking and locating steps (often in this order, but
            not always). Any information retrieval interaction must contain a compare interaction to
            enable the selection of resources that will match a requirement in the
                interaction.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-32" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-32" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">526</a>]</sup> Information retrieval algorithms and systems can be compared using an

                assume that every interaction starts with an information need that is formulated as
                a query and submitted to search a collection of resources, of which some may satisfy
                the information need.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-33" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-33" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">527</a>]</sup></p><p>Different information retrieval models can be distinguished by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>the way queries and resources are represented,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the way the comparison between resources and queries are performed,

                <span class="orgname">UC Berkeley</span> logo) also involves the same actions of comparing,

                    information need and using operators from Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) to
                    combine the components. The query is compared to individual resource properties
                    (most often terms), where the result of the comparison is either TRUE or FALSE.
                    The TRUE results are returned as a result of the query, and all other results
                    are ignored. A Boolean search does not compare or rank resources so every
                    returned resource is considered equally relevant. The advantage of the Boolean
                    search is that the results are predictable and easy to explain. However, because
                    the results of the Boolean model are not ranked by relevance, users have to sift

                    has an ability to summarize a resource. If a term such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">apple</span>”</span>
                    appears frequently in a resource, we can assume that one of the content topics
                    of the resource is apples and that a query for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">apple</span>”</span> should
                    retrieve this resource. However, only relying on term frequency to determine the
                    relevance of a resource for a query has a drawback: if the term occurs in every
                    resource in the repository, it has no distinguishing power between resources.
                    For example, if an organizing system contains only resources about apples, all
                    resources are potentially relevant for an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">apple</span>”</span> query. Hence,
                    there should be an additional mechanism to penalize the term appearing in too
                    many resources. This is done with inverse document frequency, which signals how
                    often a term or property occurs in a collection.</p><p><a id="id667472" class="indexterm"/><a id="id667481" class="indexterm"/><a id="id667529" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_document_frequency"/><span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" id="term_inverse_document_frequency" href="go01.html#gloss_inverse_document_frequency"><em class="glossterm">Inverse document frequency

                        containing a particular term. The inverse document frequency (idf) for a
                        term is defined as idf<sub>t</sub> =
                            log(N/df<sub>t</sub>), where N is the total number of
                        documents. The inverse document frequency of a term decreases the more
                        documents contain the term, providing a discriminating factor for the
                        importance of terms in a query.</span> For example, in an apple resource
                    collection, an information retrieval interaction can handle a query for
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">apples oranges</span>”</span> by lowering the importance of
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">apples</span>”</span> and increasing the importance of
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">oranges</span>”</span> in the resources that are selected as result
                    set.</p><p>Another problem with the term frequency measure occurs when resource
                    descriptions have different lengths (a very common occurrence in organizing
                    systems). Let’s say a resource description contains 20 terms and apple appears 4
                    times. Another resource description contains 200 terms and apple occurs 10
                    times. According to the term-frequency-based relevance, the second resource is
                    more relevant because it contains apple more often. However, the first resource
                    has a much higher concentration of apple: 20% of its content is apple, whereas
                    apple occurs only in a 5% concentration in the second resource. In order to
                    compensate for different resource description lengths that would bias the term
                    frequency count and the calculated relevance towards longer documents, the
                    length of the term vectors are normalized.</p><p>In a first step of a vector space search, resource descriptions are compared
                    with the terms in the query. Then, a metric combining the term frequency and the
                    inverse document frequency is used to rank resources according to their
                    relevance with respect to the query.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-36" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-36" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">531</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Latent Semantic Indexing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-9.4.2.2">Latent Semantic Indexing</h4></div></div></div><a id="id667667" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="action">Latent semantic indexing</span> is a variation of the vector space

                    resources in a collection, the method calculates which terms might be synonyms
                    of each other or otherwise related. Put another way, latent semantic indexing
                    groups terms into topics. Let’s say the terms <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">roses</span>”</span> and

                    that these terms are related. Now queries for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">flower</span>”</span> will also
                    retrieve resources that mention <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">roses.</span>”</span> This increases the chance
                    of a resource being found relevant to a query even if the query terms do not
                    match the resource description terms exactly; the technique can therefore

            part of every step from design through implementation and especially during operation.
            Evaluating the quality of interactions at different times in the design process (design
            concept, prototype, implementation, and operation) reveals both strengths and weaknesses
            to the designers or operators of the organizing system.</p><p><a id="id669009" class="indexterm"/>During the design and implementation stages, interactions need to be tested against
            the original goals of the interaction and the constraints that are imposed by the
            organizing system, its resources and external conditions. It is very common for
            processes in interactions to be tweaked or tuned to better comply with the original
            goals and intentions for the interaction. Evaluation during these stages often attempts
            to provide a calculable way to measure this compliance and supports the fine-tuning
            process. It should be an integral part of an iterative design process.</p><p><a id="id669020" class="indexterm"/>During the later implementation and operation stages, interactions are evaluated with
            respect to the dynamically changing conditions of the organizing system and its
            environment. User expectations as well as environmental conditions or constraints can
            change and need to be checked periodically. A systematic evaluation of interactions
            ensures that changes that affect an interaction are observed early and can be integrated
            in order to adjust and even improve the interaction. At these stages, more subjective
            evaluation aspects like satisfaction, experience, reputation or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">feel</span>”</span> also
            play a role in fine-tuning the interactions. This subjective part of the evaluation
            process is as important as the quantitative, objective part. Many factors during the
            design and implementation processes need to be considered and made to work together.
            Ongoing quality evaluation and feedback ensures that interactions work as
            intended.</p><p>Let’s assume that <span class="application">Shopstyle.com</span> develops a new interaction
            that lets you compare coat lengths from the offerings of their various retailers. Once
            the interaction is designed, an evaluation takes place in order to determine whether all
            coats and their lengths are integrated in the interaction and whether the coat lengths
            are measured and compared correctly. The designers would not only want to know whether
            the coat lengths are represented correctly but also whether the interaction performs
            efficiently. When the interaction is ready to be released (usually first in beta or test
            status), users and retailers will be asked whether the interaction improves their
            shopping experience, whether the comparison performs as they expected, and what they
            would change. These evaluation styles work hand in hand in order to improve the
            interaction.</p><div class="sect2" title="Interaction Aspects for Evaluation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-9.5.1">Interaction Aspects for Evaluation</h3></div></div></div><p>Evaluation aspects can be distinguished in numerous ways: by the effort and time
                to perform them (both data collection and analysis); by how quantifiable they are or
                how comparable they are with measures in other organization systems; by what
                component of the interaction or organizing system they focus on; or by the
                discipline, expertise or methodologies that are used for the evaluation.</p><p>A common and important distinction is the difference between efficiency,
                effectiveness and satisfaction. An interaction is efficient when it performs its
                actions in a timely and economical manner. An interaction is effective when it
                performs its actions correctly and completely. An interaction is satisfactory when
                it performs as expected. Satisfaction is the least quantifiable of the evaluation
                aspects because it is highly dependent on individual tastes and experiences.</p><p>Efficiency measures are usually related to engineering aspects such as the time to
                perform an action, number of steps to perform an interaction, or amount of computing
                resources used. Effectiveness measures are often developed in the fields that
                developed the algorithm for the interaction, information retrieval or machine
                learning. Satisfaction measures arise out of the user’s experience with the
                interaction<span class="symbol">—</span>they are mostly aspects of user interfaces,
                usability, or subjective and aesthetic impressions.</p><p><a id="id669128" class="indexterm"/>Although efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction are measured
                differently and affect different components of the interaction, they are equally
                important for the success of an interaction. Even if an interaction is fast, it is
                not very useful if it arrives at incorrect results. Even if an interaction works
                correctly, user satisfaction is not guaranteed. One of the challenges in designing
                interactions is that these factors invariably involve tradeoffs. A fast system
                cannot be as precise as one prioritizes the use of contextual information. An
                effective interaction might require a lot of effort from the user, which does not
                make it very easy to use, so the user satisfaction might decrease. The priorities of
                the organizing system and its designers will determine which properties to
                optimize.</p><p>Let’s continue our <span class="orgname">Shopstyle</span> coat-length comparison interaction
                example. When the coat length calculation is performed in an acceptable amount of
                time and does not consume a lot of the organizing systems resources, the interaction
                is efficient. When all coat lengths are correctly measured and compared, the
                interaction is effective. When the interaction is seamlessly integrated into the
                shopping process, is visually supported in the interface and is not cognitively
                exhausting, is it probably satisfactory for a user as it provides a useful service
                (especially for someone with irregular body dimensions). What aspect should
                Shopstyle prioritize? It will probably weigh the consequences of effectiveness
                versus efficiency and satisfaction. For a retail- and consumer-oriented organizing
                system, satisfaction is probably one of the more important aspects, so it’s highly
                likely that efficiency and effectiveness might be sacrificed (in moderation) in
                favor of satisfaction.</p><p>For a lot of organizing system interactions, however, effectiveness is the more
                important aspect, particularly for those interactions that we have looked at so far.
                If search results are not correct, then users will not be satisfied by even the most
                usable interface. Many interactions are evaluated with respect to their ability to
                return relevant resources. Why and how this is evaluated is the focus of the
                remainder of this section.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Relevance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-9.5.2">Relevance</h3></div></div></div><p><span><a id="def_relevance"/>The concept of <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_relevance"><em class="glossterm">relevance</em></a></strong></span> is pivotal in information retrieval and
                    machine learning interactions. Relevance is widely regarded as the fundamental
                    concept of information retrieval, and by extension, all of information science.
                    Despite being one of the more intuitive concepts in human communication,
                    relevance is notoriously difficult to define and has been the subject of much
                    debate over the past century.</span></p><p>Historically, relevance has been addressed in logic and philosophy since the
                notion of inference was codified (to infer B from A, A must be relevant to B). Other
                fields have attempted to deal with relevance as well: sociology, linguistics, and
                psychology in particular. The subject knowledge view, subject literature view,
                logical view, system’s view, destination’s view, pertinence view, pragmatic view and
                the utility-theoretic interpretation are different perspectives on the question of
                when something is relevant.<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-45" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-45" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">540</a>]</sup> In 1997, Mizzaro surveyed 160 research articles on the topic of
                relevance and arrived at this definition: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">relevance can be seen as a point in
                    a four-dimensional space, the values of each of the four dimensions being:
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>) Surrogate, document, information;
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>ii</em></span>) query, request, information need, problem;
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>iii</em></span>) topic, context, and each combination of them; and
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>iv</em></span>) the various time instants from the arising of
                    problem until its solution.</span>”</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-46" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-46" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">541</a>]</sup> This rather abstract definition points to the terminological ambiguity
                surrounding the concept.</p><p>For the purpose of organizing systems, relevance is a concept for evaluating
                effectiveness that describes whether a stated or implicit information need is
                satisfied in a particular user context and at a particular time. One of the
                challenges for the evaluation of relevance in organizing systems is the gap between
                a user’s information need (often not directly stated), and an expression of that
                information need (a query). This gap might result in ambiguous results in the
                interaction. For example, suppose somebody speaks the word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Paris</span>”</span>
                (query) into a smart phone application seeking advice on how to travel to Paris,
                France. The response includes offers for the <span class="orgname">Paris Hotel</span> in Las
                Vegas. Does the result satisfy the information need? What if the searcher receives
                advice on Paris but has already seen every one of the resources the organizing
                system offers? What is the correct decision on relevance here?</p><p>The key to calculating effectiveness is to be aware of what is being measured. If
                the information need as expressed in the query is measured, the topical relevance or
                topicality<span class="symbol">—</span>a system-side perspective is analyzed. If the
                information need as in a person’s mind is measured, the pertinence, utility or
                situational relevance<span class="symbol">—</span>a subjective personal perspective is
                analyzed. This juxtaposition is the point of much research and contention in the
                field of information retrieval, because topical relevance is objectively measurable,
                but subjective relevance is the real goal. In order to evaluate relevance in any
                interaction, an essential prerequisite is deciding which of these notions of
                relevance to consider.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Recall / Precision Trade-Off"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-9.5.3">The Recall / Precision Trade-Off</h3></div></div></div><p>Another decision is whether recall or precision are preferred in an

                    measures the completeness of the result set, that is, how many of the relevant
                    resources in a collection were retrieved.</span> Let’s assume that a
                collection contains 20 relevant resources for a query. A retrieval interaction
                retrieves 10 resources in a result set, 5 of the retrieved resources are relevant.
                The precision of this interaction is 50% (5 out of 10 retrieved resources are
                relevant); the recall is 25% (5 out of 20 relevant resources were
                    retrieved).<sup>[<a id="chapter-9-endnote-47" href="#ftn.chapter-9-endnote-47" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">542</a>]</sup></p><p>It is in the nature of information retrieval interactions that recall and
                precision trade off with each other. To find all relevant resources in a collection,
                the interaction has to cast a wide net and will not be very precise. In order to be
                very precise and return only relevant resources to the searcher, an interaction has
                to be very discriminating and will probably not find all relevant resources. When a
                collection is very large and contains many relevant resources for any given query,
                the priority is usually to increase precision. However, when a collection is small
                or the information need also requires finding all relevant documents (e.g., in case
                law, patent searches, or medical diagnosis support), then the priority is put on
                increasing recall.</p><p>The completeness and granularity of the organizing principles in an organizing
                system have a large impact on the trade-off between recall and precision (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter 3</a>). When resources are organized in
                fine-grained category systems and many different resource properties are described,
                high-precision searches are possible because a desired resource can be searched as
                precisely as the description or organization of the system allows. However, very
                specialized description and organization may preclude certain resources from being
                found; consequently, recall might be sacrificed. If the organization 
                is superficial<span class="symbol">—</span>like your sock drawer, 
                for example<span class="symbol">—</span>you can find all the socks you want (high recall) but
                you have to sort through a lot of socks to find the right pair (low precision). The
                trade-off between recall and precision is closely associated with the extent of the
                organization.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Key Points in Chapter Nine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-9.6">Key Points in Chapter Nine</h2></div></div></div><div class="highlights"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Interactions arise naturally from the affordances of resources or are

                        structure, metadata and information models associated with a particular
                        learning object. For example, a learning package from a provider from
                            <span class="orgname">McGraw-Hill</span> may contain content from a book, some
                        interactive quizzes, and some multimedia to support the text. CC specifies
                        how files would be organized within a directory, how links would be
                        represented, how the package would communicate with a backend server, how to
                        describe each of the components, and the like. This would enable a professor
                        or a student using any capable learning management system to import a
                            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cartridge</span>”</span> or learning material and have it appear in a

                        that while information from providers are in a structured digital form, the
                        main problem was that users were consuming the content using competing
                        systems that had their own data formats by which to accept content. Huge
                        publishers, wanting to increase distribution of their product, offered their
                        content in all these different formats. While the specifications that the
                            <abbr class="abbrev">LMS</abbr> created refer to the technical considerations in
                        creating content and tools, the process of getting to that point involved a
                        lot of organizational and political discussions. Internally, content and
                            <abbr class="abbrev">LMS</abbr> providers needed to set aside the necessary
                        resources to refactor their products to conform to the standards.
                        Externally, competing providers had to collaborate with one another to
                        create the specifications.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-9-endnote-08"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-9-endnote-08" class="para">502</a>] </sup>[Citation] <a class="link" href="bi01.html#Fidel2012" title="Human Information Interaction: An Ecological Approach to Information Behavior"><a id="cite_Fidel2012"/>(Fidel

                                    This could range from a government unit providing a

                            integrating systems between two companies, for instance, may entail the
                            exposure of business intelligence and information that should be kept
                            private. This type of exposure is too much for most businesses,
                            regardless of whether the relationship with the other business is
                            collaborative rather than competitive. There are security issues to be
                            considered, as collaborating organizations would need to access private
                            networks and secure servers. The heterogeneity in supporting organizing
                            systems along with the need to quickly evolve with the rapid changes in
                            an organization’s competitive and collaborative environment has pushed
                            organizations to shift from more vertical, isolated structures to a more
                            loosely coupled, ecosystem paradigm This has led to more componentized
                            and modularized systems that need only to exchange information or
                            transform resources when an interaction requires it.</p><p><a id="id665460" class="indexterm"/><a id="id665466" class="indexterm"/>The emerging paradigm then is to enable independent systems
                            to interoperate, or to have <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the ability of two or more systems or
                                components to exchange information and to use the information that
                                has been exchanged.</span>”</span> Because the focus is in the exchange of
                            resources or resource descriptions, independent systems need not
                            necessarily know other systems’ underlying logic or implementation, for
                            example, how they store resources. What is important is knowing what
                            kind of resource is expected and in what format (notation, writing
                            system, semantics), and what kind of information is returned for a
                            particular. This is a strategic approach to exchanging resources, as
                            systems can remain highly independent of each other. Changes in one
                            system need not necessarily affect how other systems work as long as the
                            information that is sent and received through an interface stays the
                            same. This allows greater adaptability, as changes to system logic or
                            business processes can be done in self-contained modules without
                            necessarily affecting others. The transformation then happens in an
                            intermediate space where the agreements on resource descriptions are
                            fixed.</p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-9-endnote-19"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-9-endnote-19" class="para">513</a>] </sup>[LIS] <a id="id665474" class="indexterm"/><a id="id665449" class="indexterm"/><a id="id665454" class="indexterm"/><a id="id665410" class="indexterm"/><a id="id665414" class="indexterm"/><a id="id665419" class="indexterm"/>To illustrate the difference between a unidirectional and
