            North America. The show featured two competing teams, each team consisting of two
            contestants: an ordinary civilian contestant and a celebrity. In the show’s first round,
            both teams’ members viewed a pyramid-shaped sign that displayed six category titles,
            some straightforward like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Where You Live</span>”</span> and others less conventional
            like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Things You Need to Feed.</span>”</span> Each team then had an opportunity to
            compete for points in 30-second turns. The goal was for one team member to gain points
            by identifying a word or phrase related to the category from clues provided by the other
            team member. For example, a target phrase for the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Where You Live</span>”</span> category
            might be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">zip code,</span>”</span> and the clue might be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Mine is 94705.</span>”</span>
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Things you Need to Feed</span>”</span> might include both <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">screaming baby</span>”</span>
            and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">parking meter.</span>”</span></p><p>The team that won the first round advanced to the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Winner’s Circle,</span>”</span>
            where the game was turned around. This time, only the clue giver was shown the category
            name and had to suggest concepts or instances belonging to that category so that the
            teammate could guess the category name. Clues like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">alto,</span>”</span>
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">soprano,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tenor</span>”</span> would be given to prompt the teammate
            to guess <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Singing Voices</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Types of Singers.</span>”</span></p><p>As the game progressed, the categories became more challenging. It was interesting and
            entertaining to hear the clue receiver’s initial guess and how subsequent guesses
            changed with more clues. The person giving clues would often become frustrated, because
            to them their clues seemed obvious and discriminating but would seem not to help the
            clue receivers in identifying the category. Viewers enjoyed sharing in these moments of
            vocabulary and category confusion.</p><p><a id="id634458" class="indexterm"/>The <em class="citetitle">Pyramid</em> TV game show developers created a textbook example
            for teaching about categories<span class="symbol">—</span>groups or classes of things, people, processes, events
            or anything else that we treat as equivalent<span class="symbol">—</span>and categorization<span class="symbol">—</span>the 
            process of
            assigning instances to categories. The game is a useful analog for us to illustrate many
            of the issues we discuss in this chapter. The Pyramid game was challenging, and
            sometimes comical, because people bring their own experiences and biases to
            understanding what a category means, and because not every instance of a category is
            equally typical or suggestive. How we organize reflects our thinking processes, which
            can inadvertently reveal personal characteristics that can be amusing in a social
            context. <a id="id634388" class="indexterm"/>Hence, the popularity of the <em class="citetitle">Pyramid</em> franchise, which
            began on <abbr class="abbrev">CBS</abbr> in 1973 and has been produced in 20 countries.</p><p><a id="id634425" class="indexterm"/><a id="id634431" class="indexterm"/>Many texts in library science introduce categorization via cataloging rules, a set of
            highly prescriptive methods for assigning resources to categories that some describe and
            others satirize as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mark ‘em and park ‘em.</span>”</span> Similarly, many texts in
            computer science discuss the process of defining the categories needed to create,
            process, and store information in terms of programming language constructs:
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">here’s how to define an abstract type, and here’s the data type
                system.</span>”</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-01" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-01" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">328</a>]</sup> We take a very different approach in this chapter. In the following
            sections, we discuss how and why we create categories, reviewing some important work in
            philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive psychology so that we can better understand how
            categories are created and used in organizing systems. We discuss how the way we
            organize differs when we act as individuals or as members of social, cultural, or
            institutional groups; later we share principles for creating categories, design choices
            and implementation experience. As usual, we close the chapter with a summary of the key
            points.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The What and Why of Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-6.2">The What and Why of Categories</h2></div></div></div><p><span><a id="def_categories"/>Categories are <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_equivalence_class"><em class="glossterm">equivalence
                classes</em></a></strong></span>, sets or groups of things or abstract entities that
                we treat the same.</span> This does not mean that every instance of a category is
            identical, only that from some perspective, or for some purpose, we are treating them as
            equivalent based on what they have in common. When we consider something as a member of
            a category, we are making choices about which of its properties or roles we are focusing
            on and which ones we are ignoring. We do this automatically and unconsciously most of
            the time, but we can also do it in an explicit and self-aware way.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-02" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-02" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">329</a>]</sup></p><p>When we encounter objects or situations, recognizing them as members of a category
            helps us know how to interact with them. For example, when we enter an unfamiliar
            building we might need to open or pass through an entryway that we recognize as a door.
            We might never have seen that particular door before, but it has properties and
            affordances that we know that all doors have; it has a doorknob or a handle; it allows
            access to a larger space; it opens and closes. By mentally assigning this particular
            door to the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">doors</span>”</span> category we distinguish it from <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">windows,</span>”</span>
            a category that also contains objects that sometimes have handles and that open and
            close, but which we do not normally pass through to enter another space. Categorization
            judgments are therefore not just about what is included in a class, but also about what
            is excluded from a class. Nevertheless, the category boundaries are not sharp; a
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dutch door</span>”</span> is divided horizontally in half so that the bottom can be
            closed like a door while the top can stay open like a window.</p><p>Categories are <span class="strong"><strong>cognitive and linguistic models</strong></span> for
            applying prior knowledge; creating and using categories are essential human activities.
            Categories enable us to relate things to each other in terms of similarity and
            dissimilarity and are involved whenever we perceive, communicate, analyze, predict, or
            classify. Without categories, we would perceive the world as an unorganized blur of
            things with no understandable or memorable relation to each other. Every wall-entry we
            encounter would be new to us, and we would have to discover its properties and supported
            interactions as though we had never before encountered a door. Of course, we still often
            need to identify something as a particular instance, but categories enable us to
            understand how it is equivalent to other instances. We can interchangeably relate to
            something as specific as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the wooden door to the main conference room</span>”</span> or
            more generally as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">any door.</span>”</span></p><p>All human languages and cultures divide up the world into categories. How and why this
            takes place has long been debated by philosophers, psychologists and anthropologists.
            One explanation for this differentiation is that people recognize structure in the
            world, and then create categories of things that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">go together</span>”</span> or are
            somehow similar. An alternative view says that human minds make sense of the world by
            imposing structure on it, and that what goes together or seems similar is the outcome
            rather than a cause of categorization. Bulmer framed the contrast in a memorable way by
            asking which came first, the chicken (the objective facts of nature) or the egghead (the
            role of the human intellect).<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-03" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-03" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">330</a>]</sup></p><p>A secondary and more specialized debate going on for the last few decades among
            linguists. cognitive scientists, and computer scientists concerns the extent to which
            the cognitive mechanisms involved in category formation are specialized for that purpose
            rather than more general learning processes.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-04" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-04" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">331</a>]</sup></p><p>Even before they can talk, children behave in ways that suggest they have formed
            categories based on shape, color, and other properties they can directly perceive in
            physical objects.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-05" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-05" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">332</a>]</sup> People almost effortlessly learn tens of thousands of categories embodied in
            the culture and language in which they grow up. People also rely on their own
            experiences, preferences, and goals to adapt cultural categories or create entirely
            individual ones that they use to organize resources that they personally arrange. Later
            on, through situational training and formal education, people learn to apply systematic
            and logical thinking processes so that they can create and understand categories in
            engineering, logistics, transport, science, law, business, and other institutional
            contexts.</p><p><a id="id634941" class="indexterm"/>These three contexts of <span class="strong"><strong>cultural, individual,</strong></span> and
                <span class="strong"><strong>institutional categorization</strong></span> share some core
            ideas but they emphasize different processes and purposes for creating categories, so
            they are a useful distinction.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-06" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-06" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">333</a>]</sup> Cultural categorization can be understood as a natural human cognitive
            ability that serves as a foundation for both informal and formal organizing systems.
            Individual categorization tends to grow spontaneously out of our personal activities.
            Institutional categorization responds to the need for formal coordination and
            cooperation within and between companies, governments, and other goal-oriented
            enterprises.</p><div class="sect2" title="Cultural Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.2.1">Cultural Categories</h3></div></div></div><p><span><a id="def_cultural_categories"/><span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">Cultural

                    categories upon which individual and institutional categories are usually based.
                    Cultural categories tend to describe our everyday experiences of the world and
                    our accumulated cultural knowledge. </span>Such categories describe objects,
                events, settings, internal experiences, physical orientation, relationships between
                entities, and many other aspects of human experience. Cultural categories are
                acquired primarily, with little explicit instruction, through normal exposure of
                children with their caregivers; they are associated with language acquisition and
                language use within particular cultural contexts.</p><p><a id="id635004" class="indexterm"/><a id="id635041" class="indexterm"/>Two thousand years ago <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Plato</span></span> wrote that living species could be identified by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">carving nature
                    at its joints,</span>”</span> the natural boundaries or discontinuities between types
                of things where the differences are the largest or most salient. Plato’s metaphor is
                intuitively appealing because we can easily come up with examples of perceptible
                properties or behaviors of physical things that go together that make some ways of
                categorizing them seem more natural than others.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-07" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-07" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">334</a>]</sup></p><p>Natural languages rely heavily on nouns to talk about categories of things because
                it is useful to have a shorthand way of referring to a set of properties that
                co-occur in predictable ways.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-08" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-08" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">335</a>]</sup> For example, in English (borrowed from Portuguese) we have a word for
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">banana</span>”</span> because a particular curved shape, greenish-yellow or
                yellow color, and a convenient size tend to co-occur in a familiar edible object, so
                it became useful to give it a name. The word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">banana</span>”</span> brings together
                this configuration of highly interrelated perceptions into a unified concept so we
                do not have to refer to bananas by listing their properties.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-09" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-09" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">336</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id635210" class="indexterm"/><a id="id635310" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_linguistic_relativity"/>Languages differ a great deal in
                    the words they contain and also in more fundamental ways that they require
                    speakers or writers to attend to details about the world or aspects of
                    experience that another language allows them to ignore. This idea is often

                        20<sup>th</sup> century, to propose an overly strong
                    statement of the relationships among language, culture, and thought. Whorf
                    argued that the particularities of one’s native language determine how we think
                    and what we can think about. Among his extreme ideas was the suggestion that,
                    because some Native American languages lacked words or grammatical forms that
                    refer to what we call <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">time</span>”</span> in English, they could not understand
                    the concept. More careful language study showed both parts of the claim to be
                    completely false.</p><p>Nevertheless, even though academic linguists have discredited strong versions
                    of Whorf’s ideas, less deterministic versions of <span class="strong"><strong>linguistic relativity</strong></span> have become influential and help us
                    understand cultural categorization. The more moderate position was crisply
                    characterized by Roman Jakobson, who said that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">languages differ
                        essentially in what they <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> convey and not in what

                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I spent yesterday with a neighbor.</span>”</span> In languages with
                    grammatical gender, one must choose a word that identifies the neighbor as male
                    or female.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-11" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-11" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">337</a>]</sup></p></div><p><a id="id635524" class="indexterm"/><a id="id635533" class="indexterm"/>For example, speakers of the Australian aboriginal language,
                    <span>Guugu Yimithirr</span>, don’t use concepts of left and right, but
                rather use compass-point directions. Where in English we might say to a person
                facing north, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Take a step to your left,</span>”</span> they would use their term for
                west. If the person faced south, we would change our instruction to
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">right,</span>”</span> but they would still use their term for west. Imagine how
                difficult it would be for a speaker of Guugu Yimithirr and a speaker of English to

                have different experiences and activities that give them contrasting knowledge about
                particular domains. No one would doubt that university undergraduates in Chicago
                would think differently about animals than inhabitants of Guatemalan rain forests,

                workers, and tree maintenance personnel) would categorize trees
                    differently.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-12" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-12" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">339</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Individual Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.2.2">Individual Categories</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id635696" class="indexterm"/><a id="id635709" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_individual_categorization"/>Individual categories are

                    experiences, preferences, and resource collections. Unlike cultural categories,
                    which usually develop slowly and last a long time, individual categories are
                    created by intentional activity, in response to a specific situation, or to
                    solve an emerging organizational challenge.</span> As a consequence, the
                categories in individual organizing systems generally have short lifetimes and
                rarely outlive the person who created them.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-13" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-13" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">340</a>]</sup></p><p>Individual categories draw from cultural categories but differ in two important
                ways. First, individual categories sometimes have an imaginative or metaphorical
                basis that is meaningful to the person who created them but which might distort or
                misinterpret cultural categories. Second, individual categories are often
                specialized or synthesized versions of cultural categories that capture particular
                experiences or personal history. For example, a person who has lived in China and
                Mexico, or lived with people from those places, might have highly individualized
                categories for foods they like and dislike that incorporate characteristics of both
                Chinese and Mexican cuisine.</p><p>Individual categories in organizing systems also reflect the idiosyncratic set of
                household goods, music, books, website bookmarks, or other resources that a person
                might have collected over time. The organizing systems for financial records,
                personal papers, or email messages often use highly specialized categories that are
                shaped by specific tasks to be performed, relationships with other people, events of
                personal history, and other highly individualized considerations.</p><p>Traditionally, <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" id="term_individual_categorization" href="go01.html#gloss_individual_categorization"><em class="glossterm">individual

                or shared with, others, whereas, this has become an increasingly common situation
                for people using web-based organizing system for pictures, music, or other personal
                resources. On websites like the popular <span class="application">Flickr</span> site for
                photos, people typically use existing cultural categories to tag their photos as
                well as individual ones that they invent. In particular, the typical syntactic
                constraint that tags are delimited by white space encourages the creation of new
                categories by combining existing category names using concatenation and camel case
                conventions; photos that could be categorized as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Berkeley</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Student</span>”</span> are thus tagged as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">BerkeleyStudent.</span>”</span>
                <a id="id635870" class="indexterm"/>Similar generative processes for creating individual category names are
                used with Twitter <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hashtags</span>”</span> where tweets about events are often
                categorized with an <span xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase"><em xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span> tag that
                combines an event name and a year identifier like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">#NBAFinals12.</span>”</span>
                Web-based documents and product pages in web catalogs are commonly categorized with
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ReadThis</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">BuyThis</span>”</span> tags that are meaningful for

                    that are created and used implicitly, and to individual categories that are used
                    by people acting alone, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">institutional categories</span>”</span> are created and
                    used explicitly and rationally, and most often by many people or computational
                    agents in coordination with each other. Institutional categories are most often
                    created in abstract and information-intensive domains where unambiguous and
                    precise categories are needed to regulate and systematize activity, to enable
                    information sharing and reuse, and to reduce transaction costs.</span>
                Furthermore, instead of describing the world as it is, institutional categories are
                usually defined to change or control the world by imposing semantic models that are
                more formal and arbitrary than those in cultural categories. Laws, regulations, and
                standards often specify institutional categories, along with decision rules for
                assigning resources to new categories, and behavior rules that prescribe how people
                must interact with them.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-14" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-14" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">341</a>]</sup> The rigorous definition of institutional categories enables <span class="strong"><strong>classification:</strong></span> the systematic assignment of resources
                to categories in an organizing system.</p><p>Institutional categorization stands apart from individual categorization primarily
                because it invariably requires significant efforts to reconcile mismatches between
                existing individual categories, where those categories embody useful working or
                contextual knowledge that is lost in the move to a formal institutional
                    system.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-15" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-15" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">342</a>]</sup></p><p>Institutional categorization efforts must also overcome the vagueness and
                inconsistency of cultural categories because the former must often conform to
                stricter logical standards to support inference and meet legal requirements.
                Furthermore, institutional categorization is usually a process that must be
                accounted for in a budget and staffing plans. While some kinds of institutional
                categories can be devised or discovered by computational processes, most of them are
                created through the collaboration of many individuals, typically from various parts
                of an organization or from different firms.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-16" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-16" class="footnote">343</a>]</sup> The different business or technical perspectives of the participants are
                often the essential ingredients in developing robust categories that can meet
                carefully identified requirements. And as requirements change over time,
                institutional categories must often change as well, implying version control,
                compliance testing, and other formal maintenance and governance processes.</p><p><a id="id636116" class="indexterm"/>Some institutional categories that initially had narrow or focused
                applicability have found their way into more popular use and are now considered
                cultural categories. A good example is the periodic table in chemistry, which
                Mendeleev developed in 1869 as a new system of categories for the chemical elements.
                The periodic table proved essential to scientists in understanding their properties
                and in predicting undiscovered ones. Today the periodic table is taught in
                elementary schools, and many things other than elements are commonly organized using
                a graphical structure that resembles the periodic table of elements in chemistry,
                including sci-fi films and movies, desserts, and superheroes.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-17" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-17" class="footnote">344</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="A “Categorization Continuum”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.2.4">A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Categorization Continuum</span>”</span></h3></div></div></div><p>As we have seen, the concepts of cultural, individual, and institutional
                categorization usefully distinguish the primary processes and purposes for creating
                categories. However, these three kinds of categories can fuse, clash, and recombine
                with each other. Rather than viewing them as having precise boundaries, we might
                view them as regions on a continuum of categorization activities and methods.</p><p>Consider a few different perspectives on categorizing animals as an example. <a id="id636099" class="indexterm"/>Scientific institutions categorize animals according to explicit,
                principled classification systems, such as the Linnaean taxonomy that assigns
                animals to a phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. Cultural
                categorization practices cannot be adequately described in terms of a master
                taxonomy, and are more fluid, converging with principled taxonomies sometimes, and
                diverging at other times. While human beings are classified within the animal
                kingdom in biological classification systems, people are usually not considered
                animals in most cultural contexts. Sometimes a scientific designation for human
                beings, <span xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase"><em xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase">homo sapiens</em></span> is even applied to
                human beings in cultural contexts, since the genus-species taxonomic designation has
                influenced cultural conceptions of people and (other) animals over the years.</p><p>Animals are also often culturally categorized as pets or non-pets. The category
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pets,</span>”</span> in the US mainstream, commonly includes dogs, cats, and
                fish. A pet cat might be categorized at multiple levels that incorporate individual,
                cultural, and institutional perspectives 
                on categorization<span class="symbol">—</span>as an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">animal</span>”</span> (cultural/institutional), 
                as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mammal</span>”</span>
                (institutional), as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">domestic short-hair</span>”</span> (institutional) as a
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cat</span>”</span> (cultural), and as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">troublemaker</span>”</span> or a
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">favorite</span>”</span> (individual), among other possibilities, in addition to
                being identified individually by one or more pet names. Furthermore, not everyone
                experiences pets as just dogs, cats and fish. Some people have relatively unusual
                pets, like pigs. For individuals who have pet pigs or who know people with pet pigs,
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pigs</span>”</span> may be included in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pets</span>”</span> category. If
                enough people have pet pigs, eventually <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pigs</span>”</span> could be included in
                mainstream culture’s pet category.</p><p>It is not possible to entirely separate individual, cultural and institutional
                perspectives on categorization. Individuals form subcultures and contribute to
                institutions; culture influences individuals and institutions; institutions
                influence individuals and culture.</p><p>Categorization skewed toward cultural perspectives incorporate relatively
                traditional categories, such as those learned implicitly from social interactions,
                like mainstream understandings of what kinds of animals are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pets,</span>”</span>
                while categorization skewed toward institutional perspectives emphasizes explicit,
                formal categories, like the categories employed in biological classification
                systems.</p><p><a id="ref_CAFE"/><a id="id636213" class="indexterm"/>A final example that demonstrates the interplay and conflict between the
                different contexts of categorization involves the vehicle categories in the US

                and manufacturing purposes. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Light trucks</span>”</span> might be thought of as a

                in-between-ness by specifying features that define a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">car</span>”</span> and a
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">light truck</span>”</span> is the only way to implement a consistent,
                transparent fuel efficiency policy that makes use of informal, graded distinctions
                between vehicles.</p><p><a id="id636345" class="indexterm"/>A manufacturer whose average fuel economy for all the vehicles it sells
                in a year falls below the <abbr class="abbrev">CAFE</abbr> standards has to pay penalties. This
                encourages them to produce <span><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">sport utility vehicles</span>”</span>
                        (<abbr class="abbrev">SUV</abbr>s)</span> that adhere to the <abbr class="abbrev">CAFE</abbr>
                definitions of light trucks but which most people use as passenger cars. Similarly,

                    <span class="orgname">Chrysler</span> from 2000-2010, strikes many people as a car. It
                looks like a car; we associate it with the transport of passengers rather than with
                farming; and in fact it is formally classified as a car under emissions standards.
                But like <abbr class="abbrev">SUV</abbr>s, in the <abbr class="abbrev">CAFE</abbr> classification system,
                the <span class="hardware">PT Cruiser</span> is a light truck.</p><p><abbr class="abbrev">CAFE</abbr> standards have evolved over time, becoming a theater for

                political organizations. Furthermore, <abbr class="abbrev">CAFE</abbr> standards and
                manufacturers’ response to them are influencing cultural categories, such that our
                cultural understanding of what a car looks like is changing over time as
                manufacturers design vehicles like the <span class="hardware">PT Cruiser</span> with car

                        simplest principle for creating a category is <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_enumeration"><em class="glossterm">enumeration</em></a></strong></span>; any resource in a finite or
                        countable set can be deemed a category member by that fact alone.</span>

                are defined by enumeration as a set of possible or legal values, like the 50 states

                isn’t. But there comes a size when enumerative definition is impractical or
                inefficient, and the category either must be sub-divided or be given a definition

                we only knew of planets in our own solar system, the planet category was defined by
                enumeration: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. When the outer
                planets of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were identified as planets in the

                were added to this list of planets without any changes in the cultural category. But
                in the last couple of decades many heretofore unknown planets outside our solar
                system have been detected, making the set of planets unbounded, and definition by

                music. Each value then becomes a subcategory of the music category.</p><p>The author, date, and location of creation of an intellectual resource cannot be
                directly perceived but they are also intrinsic static properties. The subject matter
                or purpose of a resource, its <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">what it is about</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">what it was
                    originally for,</span>”</span> are also intrinsic static properties that are not
                directly perceivable, especially for information resources.</p><p><a id="id637106" class="indexterm"/><a id="id637118" class="indexterm"/>The name or identifier of a resource is often arbitrary but once assigned normally
                does not change, making it an extrinsic static property. Any collection of resources
                with alphabetic or numeric identifiers as an associated property can use sorting
                order as an organizing principle to arrange spices, books, personnel records, etc.,
                in a completely reliable way. Some might argue whether this organizing principle
                creates a category system, or whether it simply exploits the ordering inherent in
                the identifier notation. For example, with alphabetic identifiers, we can think of
                alphabetic ordering as creating a recursive category system with 26 (A-Z) top-level
                categories, each containing the same number of second-level categories, and so on
                until every instance is assigned to its proper place.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-22" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-22" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">349</a>]</sup></p><p>Some resource properties are both extrinsic and dynamic because they are based on
                usage or behaviors that can be highly context-dependent. The current owner or
                location of a resource, its frequency of access, the joint frequency of access with
                other resources, or its current rating or preference with respect to alternative
                resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic properties that can be the basis for
                arranging resources and defining categories.</p><p>These properties can have a large number of values or are continuous measures, but
                as long as there are explicit rules for using property values to determine category
                assignment the resulting categories are still easy to understand and use. For
                example, we naturally categorize people we know on the basis of their current
                profession, the city where they live, their hobbies, or their age. Properties with a
                numerical dimension like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">frequency of use</span>”</span> are often transformed into
                a small set of categories like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">frequently used,</span>”</span>
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">occasionally used,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">rarely used</span>”</span> based on the
                numerical property values.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-23" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-23" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">350</a>]</sup></p><p>While there are an infinite number of logically expressible properties for any
                resource, most of them would not lead to informative and useful categories.
                Therefore, it is important to choose properties that are psychologically or
                pragmatically relevant for the resource domain being categorized. Whether something
                weighs more or less than 5000 pounds is a poor property to apply to things in
                general, because it puts cats and chairs in one category, and buses and elephants in
                    another.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-24" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-24" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">351</a>]</sup></p><p>To summarize: The most useful single properties to use for creating categories for
                an organizing system are those that are formally assigned, objectively measurable
                and orderable, or tied to well-established cultural categories, because the
                resulting categories will be easier to understand and describe.</p><p>If only a single property is used to distinguish among some set of
                resources and to create the categories in an organizing system, the choice of
                property is critical because different properties often lead to different
                categories. Using the age property, <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Bill</span> <span class="surname">Gates</span></span> and <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Mark</span> <span class="surname">Zuckerberg</span></span> are unlikely to end up in the same category of people. Using the
                wealth property, they most certainly would. Furthermore, if only one property is
                used to create a system of categories, any category with a large numbers of items in
                it will lack coherence because differences on other properties will be too apparent,
                and some category members will not fit as well as the others.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Multiple Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.3.3">Multiple Properties</h3></div></div></div><p>Organizing systems often use multiple properties to define categories. There are
                three different ways in which to do this that differ in the scope of the properties
                and how essential they are in defining the categories.</p><div class="sect3" title="Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-6.3.3.1">Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories</h4></div></div></div><p>If you have many shirts in your closet (and you are a bit compulsive or a
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">neat freak</span>”</span>), instead of just separating your shirts from your
                    pants using a single property (the part of body on which the clothes are worn)
                    you might arrange the shirts by style, and then by sleeve length, and finally by
                    color. When all of the resources in an organizing system are arranged using the
                    same sequence of resource properties, this creates a <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_logical_hierarchy"><em class="glossterm">logical
                            hierarchy</em></a></strong></span>, a multi-level category system.</p><p>If we treat all the shirts as the collection being organized, in the shirt
                    organizing system the broad category of shirts is first divided by style into
                    categories like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dress shirts,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work shirts,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">party shirts,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">athletic or sweatshirts.</span>”</span> Each of
                    these style categories is further divided until the categories are very narrow
                    ones, like the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white long-sleeve dress shirts</span>”</span> category. A
                    particular shirt ends up in this last category only after passing a series of
                    property tests along the way: it is a dress shirt, it has long sleeves, and it
                    is white. Each test creates more precise categories in the intersections of the
                    categories whose members passed the prior property tests.</p><p>Put another way, each subdivision of a category takes place when we identify
                    or choose a property that differentiates the members of the category in a way
                    that is important or useful for some intent or purpose. Shirts differ from pants
                    in the value of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">part of body</span>”</span> property, and all the shirt
                    subcategories share this <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">top part</span>”</span> value of that property.
                    However, shirts differ on other properties that determine the subcategory to
                    which they belong. <a id="id637361" class="indexterm"/><a id="id637391" class="indexterm"/><a id="id637341" class="indexterm"/>Even as we pay attention to these differentiating properties, it is
                    important to remember the other properties, the ones that members of a category
                    at any level in the hierarchy have in common with the members of the categories
                    that contain it. These properties are often described as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">inherited</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">inferred</span>”</span> from the broader
                        category.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-25" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-25" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">352</a>]</sup> For example, just as every shirt shares the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">worn on top part
                        of body</span>”</span> property, every item of clothing shares the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">can be
                        worn on the body</span>”</span> property, and every resource in the
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shirts</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pants</span>”</span> category inherits that
                    property.</p><p>Each differentiating property creates another level in the category hierarchy,
                    which raises an obvious question: How many properties and levels do we need? In
                    order to answer this question we must reflect upon the shirt categories in our
                    closet. Our organizing system for shirts arranges them with the three properties
                    of style, sleeve length, and color; some of the categories at the lowest level
                    of the resulting hierarchy might have only one member, or no members at all. You
                    might have yellow or red short-sleeved party shirts, but probably don’t have
                    yellow or red long-sleeved dress shirts, making them empty categories Obviously,
                    any category with only one member does not need any additional properties to
                    tell the members apart, so a category hierarchy is logically complete if every
                    resource is in a category by itself.</p><p>However, even when the lowest level categories of our shirt organizing system
                    have more than one member, we might choose not to use additional properties to
                    subdivide it because the differences that remain among the members do not matter
                    to us for the interactions the organizing system needs to support. Suppose we
                    have two long-sleeve white dress shirts from different shirt makers, but
                    whenever we need to wear one of them, we ignore this property. Instead, we just
                    pick one or the other, treating the shirts as completely equivalent or <a id="id637427" class="indexterm"/> substitutable. When the remaining differences between members of a
                    category do not make a difference to the users of the category, we can say that
                    the organizing system is pragmatically, or practically complete even if it is
                    not yet logically complete. That is to say, it is complete <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">for all
                        intents and purposes.</span>”</span></p><p>On the other hand, consider the shirt section of a big department store.
                    Shirts there might be organized by style, sleeve length, and color as they are
                    in our home closet, but would certainly be further organized by shirt maker and
                    by size to enable a shopper to find a <span class="orgname">Marc Jacobs</span> long-sleeve
                    blue dress shirt of size 15/35. The department store organizing system needs
                    more properties and a deeper hierarchy for the shirt domain because it has a
                    much larger number of shirt instances to organize and because it needs to
                    support many shirt shoppers, not just one person whose shirts are all the same
                    size.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Different Properties for Subsets of Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-6.3.3.2">Different Properties for Subsets of Resources</h4></div></div></div><p>A different way to use multiple resource properties to create categories in an
                    organizing system is to employ different properties for distinct subsets of the
                    resources being organized. This contrasts with the strict multi-level approach
                    in which every resource is evaluated with respect to every property.
                    Alternatively, we could view this principle as a way of organizing multiple
                    domains that are conceptually or physically adjacent, each of which has a
                    separate set of categories based on properties of the resources in that domain.
                    This principle is used for most folder structures in computer file systems and
                    by many email applications; you can create as many folder categories as you
                    want, but any resource can only be placed in one folder.</p><p>The contrasts between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, and between static
                    and dynamic ones, are helpful in explaining this method of creating organizing
                    categories. For example, you might organize all of your clothes using intrinsic
                    static properties if you keep your shirts, socks, and sweaters in different
                    drawers and arrange them by color; extrinsic static properties if you share your
                    front hall closet with a roommate, so you each use only one side of that closet
                    space; intrinsic dynamic properties if you arrange your clothes for ready access
                    according to the season; and, extrinsic dynamic properties if you keep your most
                    frequently used jacket and hat on a hook by the front door.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-26" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-26" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">353</a>]</sup></p><p>If we relax the requirement that different subsets of resources use different
                    organizing properties and allow any property to be used to describe any
                    resource, the loose organizing principle we now have is often called <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_tagging"><em class="glossterm">tagging</em></a></strong></span>. Using any property of a resource to
                    create a description is an uncontrolled and often unprincipled principle for
                    creating categories, but it is increasingly popular for organizing photos, web
                    sites, email messages in gmail, or other web-based resources. We discuss tagging
                    in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.2.2.3" title="Tagging of Web-Based Resources">Tagging of Web-Based Resources</a>,

                    categories to organize it. Some types of categories can be defined precisely
                    with just a few <span class="strong"><strong>essential</strong></span> properties. For
                    example, a prime number is a positive integer that has no divisors other than 1
                    and itself, and this category definition perfectly distinguishes prime and
                    not-prime numbers no matter how many numbers are being categorized.
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Positive integer</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">divisible only by 1 and
                        itself</span>”</span> are <span class="strong"><strong>necessary</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>defining</strong></span> properties for the prime number category;
                    every prime number must satisfy these properties. These properties are also

                    membership in the prime number category; any number that satisfies the necessary

                        those for information resources. This principle of defining categories is
                        conceptually simple and has a straightforward implementation in technologies

                    lacks any of them will not be considered to be a valid address. If we refine the

                    well when properties are conceptually distinct and the value of a property is
                    easy to perceive and examine, as they are with man-made physical resources like
                    shirts.</span></p><p>Historical experience with organizing systems that need to categorize information
                resources has shown that basing categories on easily perceived properties is often
                not effective. There might be indications <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">on the surface</span>”</span> that suggest
                the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">joints</span>”</span> between types of information resources, but these are
                often just presentation or packaging choices, That is to say, neither the size of a
                book nor the color of its cover are reliable cues for what it contains. Information
                resources have numerous descriptive properties like their title, author, and
                publisher that can be used more effectively to define categories, and these are
                certainly useful for some kinds of interactions, like finding all of the books
                written by a particular author or published by the same publisher. However, for
                practical purposes, the most useful property of an information resource is its
                    <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_aboutness"><em class="glossterm">aboutness</em></a></strong></span>, which may not be
                objectively perceivable and which is certainly hard to characterize.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-28" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-28" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">355</a>]</sup> Any collection of information resources in a library or document filing
                system is likely to be about many subjects and topics, and when an individual
                resource is categorized according to a limited number of its content properties, it
                is at the same time not being categorized using the others.</p><p>When the web first started, there were many attempts to create categories of web
                sites, most notably by <span class="orgname">Yahoo!</span> As the web grew, it became obvious
                that search engines would be vastly more useful because their near real-time text
                indexes obviate the need for <span xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase"><em xml:lang="latin" class="foreignphrase">a priori</em></span>
                assignment of web pages to categories. Rather, web search engines represent each web
                page or document in a way that treats each word or term they contain as a separate
                property.</p><p>Considering every distinct word in a document as a property stretches our notion
                of property to make it very different from the kinds of properties we have discussed
                in the previous two sections of this chapter. We do not need that generality yet, so
                we will defer further discussion of document representation for search engines until
                    <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. The Forms of Resource Descriptions">Chapter 8</a> and stick with our more intuitive
                and limited concept of property.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Family Resemblance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.3.5">Family Resemblance</h3></div></div></div><p>In general, categorization based on explicit and logical consideration of
                properties is much less effective, and sometimes not even possible for domains where
                properties lack one or more of the characteristics of separability, perceptibility,
                and necessity. Instead, we need to categorize using properties in a statistical
                rather than a logical way to come up with some measure of resemblance or similarity
                between the resource to be categorized and the other members of the category.</p><p>Consider a familiar category like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bird.</span>”</span> All birds have feathers,
                wings, beaks, and two legs. But there are thousands of types of birds, and they are
                distinguished by properties that some birds have that other birds lack: most birds
                can fly, most are active in the daytime, some swim, some swim underwater; some have
                webbed feet. These properties are correlated, a consequence of natural selection
                that conveys advantages to particular configurations of characteristics; birds that
                live in trees have different wings and feet than those that swim, for example. In
                the end, there is no single set of properties that are both necessary and sufficient
                to categorize a bird.</p><p>There are three related consequences of this complex distribution of properties
                for birds and for many other categories in cultural or natural (as opposed to
                man-made) domains. The first is an effect of <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_typicality"><em class="glossterm">typicality</em></a></strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_centrality"><em class="glossterm">centrality</em></a></strong></span> that makes some members of the category
                better examples than others, even if they share most properties. Most people
                consider a robin to be a more typical bird than a penguin.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-29" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-29" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">356</a>]</sup> Or try to define <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">friend</span>”</span> and ask yourself if all of the
                people you consider friends are equally good examples of the category. <a id="id638230" class="indexterm"/>
                <a id="id638237" class="indexterm"/> This effect is also described as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">gradience</span>”</span> in category
                membership and reflects the extent to which the most characteristic properties are
                shared.</p><p><a id="id638310" class="indexterm"/>A second consequence is that the sharing of some but not all properties
                creates what we call <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_family_resemblance"><em class="glossterm">family
                    resemblances</em></a></strong></span> among the category members; just as
                biological family members do not necessarily all share a single set of physical
                features but still are recognizable as members of the same family. This idea was
                first proposed by <a id="id638327" class="indexterm"/>the 20th century philosopher <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Ludwig</span> <span class="surname">Wittgenstein</span></span>, who used <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">games</span>”</span> as an example of a category whose
                members resemble each other according to shifting property subsets. (See the Sidebar

                    mathematics, the mind, and language. In 1999 his 
                    
                    <a class="link" href="bi01.html#Wittgenstein2002" title="“Philosophical Investigations, Sections 65-78”"><em class="citetitle">Philosophical
                        Investigations</em></a> was ranked as the most important book of
                        20<sup>th</sup> century philosophy in a poll of
                        philosophers.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-31" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-31" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">358</a>]</sup> In that book, Wittgenstein uses <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">game</span>”</span> to argue that
                    many concepts have no defining properties, and that instead there is a
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing:
                        sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.</span>”</span> He
                    contrasts board games, card games, ball games, games of skill, games of luck,
                    games with competition, solitary games, and games for amusement. Wittgenstein
                    notes that not all games are equally good examples of the category, and jokes
                    about teaching children a gambling game with dice because he knows that this is
                    not the kind of game that the parents were thinking of when they asked him to
                    teach their children a game.</p></div><p>The third consequence, when categories do not have necessary features for
                membership, is that the boundaries of the category are not fixed; the category can
                be stretched and new members assigned as long as they resemble incumbent members.
                Personal video games and multiplayer online games like <span class="application">World of
                    Warcraft</span> did not exist in Wittgenstein’s time but we have no
                trouble recognizing them as games and neither would Wittgenstein, were he alive.
                Recall that in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Foundations for Organizing Systems">Chapter 1</a> we pointed out that the
                cultural category of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">library</span>”</span> has been repeatedly extended by new
                properties, as when <span class="application">Flickr</span> is described as a web-based
                photo-sharing library. Categories defined by family resemblance or multiple and

                membership, we can use them in a composite or integrated way to determine <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_similarity"><em class="glossterm">similarity</em></a></strong></span>. Something is categorized as an A and not
                a B if it is more similar to A’s best or most typical member rather than it is to
                    B’s.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-32" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-32" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">359</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Similarity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.3.6">Similarity</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">Similarity</em></strong></span>
                is a very flexible notion whose meaning depends on the domain within which we apply
                    it.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-33" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-33" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">360</a>]</sup> To make similarity a useful mechanism for categorization we have to
                specify how the similarity measure is determined. There are four major psychological
                approaches that propose different functions for computing similarity: feature- or
                property-based, geometry-based, alignment-based, and transformational.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-34" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-34" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">361</a>]</sup> Each of these psychological definitions or models of similarity has
                analogues in or can be applied to organizing systems.</p><p>An influential model of feature-based similarity calculation is the contrast model
                proposed by <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Amos</span> <span class="surname">Tversky</span></span>. This model matches the features or properties of the two things being
                compared and computes a similarity measure according to three sets of features:
                those they share, those the first has that the second lacks, and those that the
                second has that the first lacks. The similarity that results from the set of shared
                features is reduced by the two sets of distinctive features. The weights or
                importance assigned to each of these three sets can be adjusted to explain how items
                are assigned to a set of categories.</p><p><a id="id638727" class="indexterm"/>We often use a heuristic version of feature-based similarity calculation when we
                create multi-level or hierarchical category systems to ensure that the categories at
                each level are at the same level of abstraction or breadth. For example, if we were
                organizing a collection of musical instruments, it would not seem correct to have
                subcategories of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">woodwind instruments,</span>”</span>
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">violins,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cellos</span>”</span> because the feature-based
                similarity among the categories is not the same for all pairwise comparisons among
                the categories; violins and cellos are simply too similar to each other to be
                separate categories given woodwinds as a category.</p><p>Geometric models are a second type of similarity framework, in which items are
                represented as points in a multi-dimensional feature- or property-space and
                similarity is calculated by measuring the distance between them. How distance is
                measured depends on the type of properties that characterize a domain. When
                properties that are psychologically or perceptually combined, a Euclidean distance
                function best accounts for category judgments; but when properties can be
                conceptually separated, a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">city block</span>”</span> distance function works best to
                explain psychological data, because that ensures that each property value
                contributes its full amount. Geometric similarity functions are commonly used by
                search engines; if a query and document are each represented as a vector of search
                terms, relevance is determined by the distance between the vectors in the
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">document space.</span>”</span> We will discuss how this works in greater detail
                in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Interactions with Resources">Chapter 9</a>.</p><p>Alignment-based similarity models have been proposed for domains in which the
                items to be categorized are characterized by abstract or complex relationships with
                their features and with each other. For example, some categories are best understood
                as metaphors that have become conventionalized, and category judgments are made by
                aligning and projecting aspects of one item or entity onto another. With this model
                an entity need not be understood as inherently possessing features shared in common
                with another entity. Rather, people project features from one thing to another in a
                search for congruities between things, much as clue receivers in the second round of
                the <em class="citetitle">Pyramid</em> game search for congruities between examples
                provided by the clue giver in order to guess the target category. For example, a
                clue like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">screaming baby</span>”</span> can suggest many categories, as can
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">parking meter.</span>”</span> But the likely intersection of the interactions
                one can have with babies and parking meters is that they are both <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Things you
                    need to feed.</span>”</span></p><p>Transformational models for calculating similarity assume that the similarity
                between two things is inversely proportional to the complexity of the transformation
                required to turn one into the other. For example, one way to perform the <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_name_matching"><em class="glossterm">name matching</em></a></strong></span> task of determining when two different
                strings denote the same person, object, or other named entity is to calculate the
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">edit distance</span>”</span> between them, the number of changes required to
                transform one into the other. Two strings with a short edit distance might be
                variant spellings or misspellings of the same name.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-35" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-35" class="footnote">362</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Theory-Based Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.3.7">Theory-Based Categories</h3></div></div></div><p><span><a id="def_theory-based_category"/>Another principle for creating categories
                    is organizing things in ways that fit a theory or story that makes a particular
                    categorization sensible. A <span class="bold"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_theory-based_category"><em class="glossterm">theory-based category</em></a></strong></span> can win out even if
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">family resemblance</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">similarity</span>”</span> with respect
                    to visible properties would lead to a different category assignment.</span>
                For example, whales are categorized as mammals by biologists even though they share
                their most visible properties with fish because the theory of
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mammalness</span>”</span> emphasizes the property of nursing with mother’s
                milk.</p><p>Theory-based categories based on origin or causation are especially important with
                highly inventive and computational resources because unlike natural kinds of
                physical resources, little or none of what they can do or how they behave is visible
                on the surface (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.1" title="Affordance and Capability">Affordance and Capability</a>). Consider all of the different
                appearances and form factors of the resources that we categorize as

                or theory-like principle that does not depend on their visible properties.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-36" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-36" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">363</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Goal-Derived Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.3.8">Goal-Derived Categories</h3></div></div></div><p>A final principle for creating categories is to organize resources that go

            Here, we examine the idea that some levels of abstraction in a system of categories are
            more basic or natural than others. We also consider how the choices we make affect how
            we create the organizing system in the first place, and how they shape our interactions
            when we need to find some resources that are categorized in it.</p><div class="sect2" title="Category Abstraction and Granularity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.4.1">Category Abstraction and Granularity</h3></div></div></div><p>We can identify any resource as a unique instance or as a member of a class of
                resources. The size of this class<span class="symbol">—</span>the number of resources that are treated as
                equivalent<span class="symbol">—</span>is determined by the properties or characteristics we consider when we
                examine the resources in some domain. The way we think of a resource domain depends
                on context and intent, so the same resource can be thought of abstractly in some
                situations and very concretely in others. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter 4</a>, this influences the nature and extent of resource
                description, and as we’ve seen in this chapter, it then influences the nature and
                extent of categories we can create.</p><p>Consider the regular chore of putting away clean clothes. We can consider any item
                of clothing as just that<span class="symbol">—</span>a member of a broad category whose
                members are any kind of garment that a person might wear. Using one category for all
                clothing, that is, failing to distinguish among the various items in any useful or
                practical way would likely mean that we would keep our clothes in a big unorganized
                pile.</p><p>However, we cannot wear any random combination of clothing items<span class="symbol">—</span>we need a shirt, a pair of pants, socks, and so on.
                Clearly, our indiscriminate clothing category is too broad for most purposes. So
                instead, most people organize their clothes in more fine-grained categories that fit
                the normal pattern of how they wear clothes. For example, everyone probably
                separates their shirts, pants, and socks when they put away their clothes after
                doing their laundry. Some pants and shirts may merit wooden hangers; others may rest
                in special drawers.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3.2" title="Single Properties">Single Properties</a> we described an organizing system for the
                shirts in our closet, so let’s talk about socks instead. When it comes to socks,
                most people think that the basic unit is a pair because they always wear two socks
                at a time. If you are going to need to find socks in pairs, it seems sensible to
                organize them into pairs when you are putting them away. Some people might further
                separate their dress socks from athletic ones, and then sort these socks by color or
                material, creating a hierarchy of sock categories analogous to the shirt categories
                in our previous example. We note, parenthetically, that not everyone works this hard
                when putting their clothes away; some people toss all the single, unpaired socks in
                a drawer and then rummage around when they need to find a matching pair of socks.
                People differ in their preferences or tolerances for the amount of granularity in an
                organizing system and we need to expect and respect these differences.</p><p>Questions of resource abstraction and granularity also emerge whenever the
                information systems of different firms, or different parts of a firm, need to
                exchange information or be merged into a single system. All parties must define the
                identity of each thing in the same way, or in ways that can be related or mapped to
                each other either manually or electronically.</p><p>For example, how should a business system deal with a customer’s address? Printed
                on an envelope, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">an address</span>”</span> typically appears as a comprehensive,
                multi-line text object. Inside an information system, however, an address is stored
                as separate information components for each printed line, or as a set of distinctly
                identifiable information components. This fine-grained organization makes it easier
                to sort customers by city or postal codes, for sales and marketing purposes.
                Incompatibilities in the abstraction and granularity of these information
                components, and the ways in which they are presented and reused in documents, will
                cause interoperability problems when businesses need to share information, some of
                which may be difficult to detect because of the <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_vocabulary_problem"><em class="glossterm">vocabulary problem</em></a>.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-38" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-38" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">365</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Basic or Natural Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.4.2">Basic or Natural Categories</h3></div></div></div><p>We can describe category abstraction in terms of a hierarchy of <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">superordinate</em></strong></span>,
                    <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">basic</em></strong></span>, and
                    <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">subordinate</em></strong></span> category levels. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Clothing,</span>”</span>
                for example, is a superordinate category, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shirts</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">socks</span>”</span> are basic categories, and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white long-sleeve dress
                    shirts</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white wool hiking socks</span>”</span> are subordinate
                categories. Members of basic level categories like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shirts</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">socks</span>”</span> have many perceptual properties in common, and are more
                strongly associated with motor movements than members of superordinate categories.
                Members of subordinate categories have many common properties, but these properties
                are also shared by members of other subordinate categories at the same level of
                abstraction in the category hierarchy. That is, while we can identify many
                properties shared by all <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">white long-sleeve dress shirts,</span>”</span> many of them
                are also properties of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">blue long-sleeve dress shirts</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">black
                    long-sleeve pullover shirts.</span>”</span></p><p>Psychological research suggests that some levels of abstraction in a system of
                categories are more basic or natural than others. An implication for organizing
                system design is that basic level categories are highly efficient in terms of the
                cognitive effort they take to create and use.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-39" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-39" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">366</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Recall and Precision Tradeoff"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.4.3">The Recall and Precision Tradeoff</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id639625" class="indexterm"/>The abstraction level we choose determines how precisely we identify resources.
                When we want to make a general claim, or communicate that the scope of our interest
                is broad, we use superordinate categories, as when we ask, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">How many animals
                    are in the <span class="orgname">San Diego Zoo</span>?</span>”</span> But we use precise
                subordinate categories when we need to be specific: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">How many adult emus are
                    in the <span class="orgname">San Diego Zoo</span> today?</span>”</span></p><p>If we return to our clothing example, finding a pair of white wool hiking socks is
                very easy if the organizing system for socks creates fine-grained categories. When
                resources are described or arranged with this level of detail, a similarly detailed
                specification of the resources you are looking for yields precisely what you want.
                When you get to the place where you keep white wool hiking socks, you find all of
                them and nothing else. On the other hand, if all your socks are tossed unsorted into
                a sock drawer, when you go sock hunting you might not be able to find the socks you
                want and you will encounter lots of socks you do not want. But you won’t have put
                time into sorting them, which many people don’t enjoy doing; you can spend time
                sorting or searching depending on your preferences.</p><p>If we translate this example into the jargon of information retrieval, we say that
                more fine-grained organization reduces <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">recall</em></strong></span>, the number of resources you
                find or retrieve in response to a query, but increases the <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">precision</em></strong></span> of the recalled
                set, the proportion of recalled items that are relevant. Broader or coarse-grained
                categories increase recall, but lower precision. We are all too familiar with this
                hard bargain when we use a web search engine; a quick one-word query results in many
                pages of mostly irrelevant sites, whereas a carefully crafted multi-word query
                pinpoints sites with the information we seek. We will discuss recall, precision, and
                evaluation of information retrieval more extensively in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Interactions with Resources">Chapter 9</a>.</p><p><a id="id639663" class="indexterm"/><a id="id639791" class="indexterm"/>This mundane example illustrates the fundamental tradeoff between
                organization and retrieval. A tradeoff between the investment in organization and
                the investment in retrieval persists in nearly every organizing system. The more
                effort we put into organizing resources, the more effectively they can be retrieved.
                The more effort we are willing to put into retrieving resources, the less they need
                to be organized first. The allocation of costs and benefits between the organizer
                and retriever differs according to the relationship between them. Are they the same
                person? Who does the work and who gets the benefit?</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Category Audience and Purpose"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.4.4">Category Audience and Purpose</h3></div></div></div><p>The ways in which people categorize depend on the goals of categorization, the
                breadth of the resources in the collection to be categorized, and the users of the
                organizing system. Suppose that we want to categorize languages. Our first step
                might be determining what constitutes a language, since there is no widespread
                agreement on what differentiates a language from a dialect, or even on whether such
                a distinction exists.</p><p>What we mean by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">English</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Chinese</span>”</span> as categories
                can change depending on the audience we are addressing and what our purpose is,
                    however.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-40" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-40" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">367</a>]</sup> A language learning school’s representation of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">English</span>”</span>
                might depend on practical concerns such as how the school’s students are likely to
                use the language they learn, or on which teachers are available. For the purposes of
                a school teaching global languages, one of the standard varieties of English (which
                are associated with more political power), or an amalgamation of standard varieties
                might be thought of as an instance (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">English</span>”</span>) of the category
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Languages.</span>”</span></p><p>Similarly, the category structure in which <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Chinese</span>”</span> is situated can
                vary with context. While some schools might not conceptualize <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Chinese</span>”</span>
                as a category encompassing multiple linguistic varieties, but rather as a single
                instance within the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Languages</span>”</span> category, another school might teach
                its students Mandarin, Wu, and Cantonese as dialects within the language category
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Chinese,</span>”</span> that are unified by a single standard <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_writing_system"><em class="glossterm">writing system</em></a>. In addition, a
                linguist might consider Mandarin, Wu, and Cantonese to be mutually unintelligible,
                making them separate languages within the broader category <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Chinese</span>”</span>
                for the purpose of creating a principled language classification system.</p><p>In fact languages can be categorized in multitude of ways. If we are concerned
                with linguistic diversity and the survival of minority languages, we might
                categorize some languages as endangered in order to mobilize language preservation
                efforts. We could also categorize languages in terms of shared linguistic ancestors
                    (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Romance languages,</span>”</span> for example), in terms of what kinds of
                sounds they make use of, by how well we speak them, by regions they are commonly
                spoken in, whether they are signed or unsigned, and so on. We could also expand our
                definition of the languages category to include artificial computer languages, or
                body language, or languages shared by people 
                and their pets<span class="symbol">—</span>or thinking more metaphorically, 
                we might include the language of fashion.</p><p>If people could only categorize in a single way, the
                    <em class="citetitle">Pyramid</em> game show, where contestants guess what category
                is illustrated by the example provided by a clue giver, would pose no challenge. The
                creative possibilities provided by categorization allow people to order the world
                and refer to interrelationships among conceptions through a kind of allusive
                shorthand. When we talk about the language of fashion, we suggest that in the
                context of our conversation, instances like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">English,</span>”</span>
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Chinese,</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fashion</span>”</span> are alike in ways that
                distinguish them from other things that we would not categorize as languages.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Implementing Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-6.5">Implementing Categories</h2></div></div></div><p>We have emphasized the intellectual choices and challenges that arise in the design of
            a system of categories because, at their essence, categories are conceptual or mental
            constructs. We use categories in a mostly invisible way when we communicate, solve
            problems, or organize our kitchens and clothes closets. Sometimes categories are more
            apparent, as when we see signs and labels in the aisles of department or grocery stores
            to help us find things, when we put our socks and t-shirts in different dresser drawers,
            or when we create a system of folders and directories in our file cabinets or on our
            personal computers.</p><p>The most visible implementations of a category system are usually those for
            institutional categories, especially those that are embodied in the organizing systems
            for information resources where category membership can be verified by technology and
            the boundaries between categories are precise. In this final section of the chapter we
            briefly discuss some of the most important technologies for implementing categories,
            contrasting those that are appropriate for categories where membership is defined using
            properties with those that work for categories defined on the basis of
            similarity.</p><div class="sect2" title="Implementing Classical Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-6.5.1">Implementing Classical Categories</h3></div></div></div><p>The most conceptually simple and straightforward implementation of categories in

                features. This approach results in prescriptive categories with explicit and clear
                boundaries. Classifying items into the categories is objective and deterministic and
                supports a well-defined notion of <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_validation"><em class="glossterm">validation</em></a> to determine unambiguously whether some instance is a
                member of the category.</p><p><a id="id639941" class="indexterm"/><a id="id640020" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_decision_tree"/>The most direct way to implement

                    tests.</span> For example, we can classify numbers as prime or not with two
                tests: is it greater than 1, and does it have any divisors other than itself and 1.
                More complex categories need more tests.

                weigh at least 6000 pounds), and (4) function (numerous sub-tests that classify

                optimal representational format for formally defined institutional categories.
                Categories defined using natural language can easily be incomplete, inconsistent, or
                ambiguous, so they are sometimes defined using <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">simplified writing</span>”</span> or
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">business rules</span>”</span> that in the aggregate create a decision tree or

                specified with natural language, despite its ambiguities. Sometimes this is even
                intentional to allow institutional categories embodied in laws to evolve in the

                of properties and content types. Instead, we have a notion of typical novels and
                their characteristic properties, and some things that are considered novels are far
                from typical in their structure and content.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-46" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-46" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">373</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id640642" class="indexterm"/>Nevertheless, categories like narrative document types can sometimes be

                type would have much optionality, be flexible about order, and expect only text in
                its sections, paragraphs and headings. Even very lax document schemas can be useful
                in making content management, reuse, and formatting more efficient.</p><p>Category types that are furthest in character from the classical model are those
                that are not defined using properties in any explicit way. We do not use technology

                that uses similarity as its basis.</p><p><a id="id640726" class="indexterm"/>In particular, <span><a id="def_machine_learning"/><span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_machine_learning"><em class="glossterm">Machine
                            learning</em></a></strong></span> is a subfield of computer science that
                    develops and applies algorithms that accomplish tasks that are not explicitly
                    programmed; creating categories and assigning items to them is an important
                    subset of machine learning. Two subfields of machine learning that are
                    particularly relevant to organizing systems are <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">supervised</em></strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong><em class="glossterm">unsupervised</em></strong></span>
                    learning.</span> In supervised learning, a machine learning program is trained
                by giving it sample items or documents that are labeled by category, and the program
                learns to assign new items to the correct categories. In unsupervised learning, the
                program gets the samples but has to come up with the categories on its own by
                discovering the underlying correlations between the items; that is why unsupervised
                learning is sometimes called <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_statistical_pattern_recognition"><em class="glossterm">statistical pattern recognition</em></a></strong></span>. This generally
                takes longer, since the program isn’t given correct answers to use in improving its
                performance, as it is in the supervised case. As we pointed out in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.2.1" title="Cultural Categories">Cultural Categories</a>, we learn most of our cultural categories without any
                explicit instruction about them, so it is not surprising that computational models
                of categorization developed by cognitive scientists often employ unsupervised
                statistical learning methods. We will now briefly discuss unsupervised learning and
                return to supervised learning in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories">Chapter 7</a>.</p><p><a id="id640802" class="indexterm"/><a id="id640774" class="indexterm"/>There are far too many unsupervised learning techniques for
                categorization to even mention them all, let alone describe how they work. The ones
                that are most relevant for us are called <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_clustering"><em class="glossterm">clustering</em></a></strong></span> techniques, which share the same goal and a
                few basic methods. <span><a id="def_clustering"/>Clustering techniques share the goal
                    of creating meaningful categories from a collection of items whose properties
                    are hard to directly perceive and evaluate; this is especially true with large
                    collections of heterogeneous documents, where goals might be to find categories
                    of documents with the same topics, genre, sentiment, or other characteristic
                    that cannot easily be reduced to specific property tests.</span></p><p>The first shared method is that clustering techniques start with an initially
                uncategorized set of items or documents from which some measures of inter-item
                similarity can be calculated.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-47" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-47" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">374</a>]</sup></p><p>The second shared method is that categories are created by putting items that are
                most similar into the same category. <span>Hierarchical clustering
                    approaches</span> start with every item in its own category. Other approaches,
                notably one called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">K-means clustering,</span>”</span> start with a fixed
                number of K categories initialized with a randomly chosen item or document.</p><p>The third shared method is refining the system of categories by iterative
                similarity recalculation each time an item is added to a category. Approaches that
                start with every item in its own category create a hierarchical system of categories
                by merging the two most similar categories, recomputing the similarity between the
                new category and the remaining ones, and repeating this process until all the
                categories are merged into a single category at the root of a category tree.
                Techniques that start with a fixed number of categories do not create new ones but
                instead repeatedly recalculate the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">center</span>”</span> of the category by
                adjusting its property representation to the average of all its members after a new
                member is added.<sup>[<a id="chapter-6-endnote-48" href="#ftn.chapter-6-endnote-48" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">375</a>]</sup></p><p>The end result of clustering is a statistically optimal set of categories in which
                the similarity of all the items within a category is larger than the similarity of
                items that belong to different categories. This is a statistical result produced by
                a computer, and there is no guarantee that the categories are meaningful ones that
                can be named and used by people. In the end, clustering relies on the data analyst
                or information scientist to make sense of the clusters if they are to be used to
                classify resources. In many cases it is better to start with categories created by
                people and then teach them to computers that can use supervised learning techniques
                to assign new resources to the categories.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Key Points in Chapter Six"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-6.6">Key Points in Chapter Six</h2></div></div></div><div class="highlights"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Categories are <span class="bold"><strong>equivalence classes</strong></span>: sets

                        existence of perceptual discontinuities is not sufficient to account for
                        category formation. Instead, people assume that members of a biological

                        people to focus on the salient differences, thereby creating categories.
                        Property clusters enable inferences about causality, which then builds a
                        framework on which additional categories can be created and refined. For

                        are then inferred as the causal basis of flying, and wings become more
                        salient.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-6-endnote-08"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-6-endnote-08" class="para">335</a>] </sup>[CogSci] <a id="id635168" class="indexterm"/><a id="id635173" class="indexterm"/>Pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions,

                        object like a banana is very large. We can pick, peel, slice, smash, eat, or
                        throw a banana, so instead of capturing this complexity in the meaning of
                        banana it gets parceled into the verbs that can act on the banana noun.
                        Doing so requires languages to use verbs to capture a broader and more
                        abstract type of meaning that is determined by the nouns they are combined
                        with. Familiar verbs like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">set,</span>”</span> <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">put,</span>”</span> and
                            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">get</span>”</span> have dozens of different senses as a result because
                        they go with so many different nouns. We set fires and we set tables, but
                        fires and tables have little in common. The intangible character of verbs
                        and the complexity of multiple meanings make it easier to focus instead on
                        their associated nouns, which are often physical resources, and create
                        organizing systems that emphasize the latter rather than the former. We
                        create organizing systems that focus on verbs when we are categorizing
                        actions, behaviors, or services where the resources that are involved are

                        identify those properties and how they are used, there would not be any work
                        for a similarity mechanism to do. Another situation where similarity has
                        been described as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mostly vacuous</span>”</span> explanation for
                        categorization is with abstract categories or metaphors. Goldstone says

                            both be metaphorical prisons... and may seem similar in that both

                        contains a field, or combination of fields, known as a primary key, which is
                        used to define and restrict membership in the table. A table of email
                        messages in a database might define an email message as a unique combination
                        of sender address, recipient address, and date/time when the message was
                        sent, by enforcing a primary key on a combination of these fields. Similar
                        to category membership based on a single, monothetic set of properties,
                        membership in this email message table is based on a single set of required
                        criteria. An item without a recipient address cannot be admitted to the
                        table. In categorization terms, the item is not a member of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">email
                            message</span>”</span> class because it does not have all the properties
                        necessary for membership.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-6-endnote-45"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-6-endnote-45" class="para">372</a>] </sup>[Computing] <a id="id640520" class="indexterm"/><a id="id640525" class="indexterm"/>Like <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_data_schema"><em class="glossterm">data

                        the construction and manipulation of data. However, programming classes,
                        like other implementations that are characterized by specificity and rule
                        enforcement, can vary widely in the degree to which rules are specified and
                        enforced. While some class definitions are very rigid, others are more
                        flexible. Some languages have abstract types that have no instances but
                        serve to provide a common ancestor for specific implemented types.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-6-endnote-46"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-6-endnote-46" class="para">373</a>] </sup>[CogSci] <a id="id640611" class="indexterm"/><a id="id640619" class="indexterm"/><a id="id640653" class="indexterm"/>The existence of chapters might suggest that an item is a novel;
                        however, a lack of chapters need not automatically indicate that an item is
                        not a novel. Some novels are hypertexts that encourage readers to take
                        alternative paths. Many of the writings by <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">James</span> <span class="surname">Joyce</span></span> and <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Samuel</span> <span class="surname">Beckett</span></span> are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">stream of consciousness</span>”</span> works that lack a
                        coherent plot, yet they are widely regarded as novels.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-6-endnote-47"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-6-endnote-47" class="para">374</a>] </sup>[Computing] <a id="id640828" class="indexterm"/>Some approaches represent each item as a vector of property
                        values; documents are usually represented as vectors of frequency-weighted
                        terms; in either case the items can be represented as points in a
                        multidimensional space of these properties. Similarity can then be
                        calculated by measuring the distance between items in this space. A popular

                        either by direct judgments of the similarity of each pair of items or by
                        indirect measures like the accuracy in deciding whether two sounds, colors,
                        or images are the same or different. The assumption is that the
                        confusability of two items reflects how similar they are.</p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.chapter-6-endnote-48"><p><sup>[<a href="#chapter-6-endnote-48" class="para">375</a>] </sup>[Computing] <a id="id640931" class="indexterm"/>Unlike <span>hierarchical clustering</span> methods that
                        have a clear stopping rule when they create the root category, k-means
                        clustering methods run until the centroids of the categorize stabilize.
                        Furthermore, because the k-means algorithm is basically just hill-climbing,
                        and the initial category <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">seed</span>”</span> items are random, it can easily
                        get stuck in a local optimum. So it is desirable to try many different
