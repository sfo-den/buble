            distinctions as we discuss how resource identity is determined for <span class="hardware">physical
                resources</span>, bibliographic resources, resources in information systems, as
            well as for <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_active_resources"><em class="glossterm">active resources</em></a> and

            <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.4" title="Naming Resources">Naming Resources</a> then tackles the problems and principles for naming: once
            we have identified resources, how do we name and distinguish them? Finally, <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.5" title="Resources over Time">Resources over Time</a> considers issues that emerge with respect to resources over
            time.</p><div class="sect2" title="What Is a Resource?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-3.1.1">What Is a Resource?</h3></div></div></div><p>Resources are what we organize.</p><p>We introduced the concept of <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_resource"><em class="glossterm">resource</em></a> in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.2.1" title="The Concept of “Resource”">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Resource</span>”</span></a> with its ordinary sense
                of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><span>anything of value that can support goal-oriented
                    activity</span></span>”</span> and emphasized that a group of resources can be
                treated as a <a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_collection"><em class="glossterm">collection</em></a> in an organizing system. And what do we mean by
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">anything of value,</span>”</span> exactly? It might seem that the question of
                    <span class="strong"><strong><a class="glossterm" href="go01.html#gloss_identity"><em class="glossterm">identity</em></a></strong></span>, of what a single resource is, should not
                be hard to answer. After all, we live in a world of resources, and
                    <span class="action">finding</span>, <span class="action">selecting</span>,
                    <span class="action">describing</span>, <span class="action">arranging</span>, and
                    <span class="action">referring</span> to them are everyday activities.</p><p>Nevertheless, even when the resources we are dealing with are <span class="hardware">tangible
                    things</span>, how we go about organizing them is not always obvious, or at
                least not obvious to each of us in the same way at all times. Not everyone thinks of
                them in the same way. Recognizing something in the sense of perceiving it as a
                    <span class="hardware">tangible thing</span> is only the first step toward being able to
                organize it and other resources like it. Which properties garner our attention, and
                which we use in organizing depends on our experiences, purposes, and context.</p><p><span>We <span class="action">add information</span> to a resource when we
                        <span class="action">name</span> or <span class="action">describe</span> it; it then becomes more
                    than <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">it.</span>”</span></span>
                <span>We can describe the same resource in many different ways.</span>
                <span>At various times we can consider any given resource to be one of many
                    members of a broad category, as one of the few members of a narrow category, or
                    as a unique instance of a category with only one member.</span> For example,
                we might recognize something as a piece of clothing, as a sock, or as the specific
                dirty sock with the hole worn in the heel from yesterday’s long hike. However, even
                after we categorize something, we might not be careful how we talk about it; we
                often refer to two objects as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the same thing</span>”</span> when what we mean is
                that they are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the same type of thing.</span>”</span> Indeed, we could debate whether
                a category with only one possible member is really a category, because it blurs an
                important distinction between particular items or instances and the class or type to
                which they belong.</p><p>The issues that matter and the decisions we need to make about resource instances
                and resource classes and types are not completely separable. Nevertheless, we will
                strive to focus on the former ones in this chapter and the latter ones in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter 6</a>.</p><div class="sect3" title="Resources with Parts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-3.1.1.1">Resources with Parts</h4></div></div></div><p>As tricky as it can be to decide what a resource is when you are dealing with
                    single objects, it is even more challenging when the resources are objects or
                    systems composed of other parts. In these cases, we must focus on the entirety
                    of the object or system and treat it as a resource, treat its constituent parts
                    as resources, and deal with the relationships between the parts and the whole,
                    as we do with engineering drawings and assembly procedures.</p><p><span>How many <span class="hardware">things</span> is a car?</span> If you are
                    imagining the car being assembled you might think of several dozen large parts
                    like the frame, suspension, drive train, gas tank, brakes, engine, exhaust
                    system, passenger compartment, doors, and other pre-assembled components. Of
                    course, each of those components is itself 
                    made up of many parts<span class="symbol">—</span>think of the engine, or even just the radio. Some
                    sources have counted ten or fifteen thousand parts in the average car, but
                    even at that precise granularity a lot of parts are still complex things. There
                    are screws and wires and fasteners and on and on; really too many to
                    count.</p><p>Ambiguity about the number of parts in the whole holds for information
                    resources too; a newspaper can be considered a single resource but it might also
                    consist of multiple sections, each of which contains separate stories, each of
                    which has many paragraphs, and so on. <span>From the typesetter’s point of
                        view, each character in a sentence can be taken as a distinct resource,
                        selected from a font of similar resources.</span></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and “Smart Things” as Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section-3.1.1.2">Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Smart
                        Things</span>”</span> as Resources</h4></div></div></div><p>Information resources generally pose additional challenges in their
                        <span class="action">identification</span> and <span class="action">description</span> because
                    their most important property is usually their content, which is not easily and
                    consistently recognizable. <span>Organizing systems for information resources
                        in physical form, like those for libraries, have to juggle the duality of
                        their tangible embodiment with what is inherently an abstract information
                        resource; that is, the printed book versus the knowledge the book
                        contains.</span> Here, the organizing system emphasizes description
                    resources or surrogates, like bibliographic records that describe the
                    information content, rather than their physical properties.</p><p>Another important question in libraries is: <span>What set of resources
                        should be treated as the same work because they contain essentially similar
                        intellectual or artistic content?</span> We may talk about Shakespeare’s
                    play <em class="citetitle">Macbeth</em>, but what is this thing we call
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Macbeth</span>”</span>? Is it a particular string of words, saved in a
                    computer file or handwritten upon a folio? Is it the collection of words printed
                    with some predetermined font and pagination? Are all the editions and printings
                    of these words the same <em class="citetitle">Macbeth</em>? How should we organize
                    the numerous live and recorded performances of plays and movies that share the
                        <em class="citetitle">Macbeth</em> name? What about creations based on or
                    inspired by <em class="citetitle">Macbeth</em> that do not share the title
                        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Macbeth,</span>”</span> like the Kurosawa film <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">

                this single resource and other resources like it. These problems are closely
                related. Once you have decided what to treat as a resource, you create a name or an

                    vegetable, and mineral kingdoms by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 is today deeply
                    embedded in most languages and cultures to create a hierarchical system of

                    constraints on category membership that are manifested in patterns of shared
                    properties; once a resource is identified as a member of one category it must
                    also be a member of another with which it shares some but not all
                    properties.</span> For example, a marble statue in a museum must also be a
                kind of material resource, and a fish in an aquarium must also be a kind of animal
                resource.</p><p>For information resources, easily perceived properties are less reliable and
                correlated, so we more often distinguish domains based on semantic properties; the

                according to their typical subject matter, or the type of content, rather than
                according to the great variety of physical forms in which we might encounter them.
                Arranging <span class="hardware">books</span> by color or size might be sensible for very
                small collections, or in a photo studio, but organizing according to physical
                properties would make it extremely impractical to find books in a large

                <a id="id602666" class="indexterm"/>We can arrange types of information resources in a hierarchy but because
                the category boundaries are not sharp it is more useful to view domains of

                    Transactional document types are usually created mechanically and, as a result,

                In fact, we have little difficulty recognizing an object or a person even if we are
                seeing them from a novel distance and viewing angle or with different lighting,
                shading, and so on. When we watch a football game, we do not have any trouble

                belongs, and deciding which of those categories is appropriate to emphasize. Most of
                the time we carry out these tasks in an automatic, unconscious way; at other times
                we make conscious decisions about them. For some purposes we consider a sports team

                Panizzi wondered: How do we differentiate similar objects in a library catalog? His
                solution was a catalog organized by author name with an index of subjects, along
                with his newly concocted <em class="citetitle">Rules for the Compilation of the
                    Catalogue</em>. This contained 91 rules about how to identify and arrange
                author names and titles and what to do with anonymous works. The rules were meant to
                codify how to differentiate and describe each singular resource in his library.
                Taken together, the rules serve to group all the different editions and versions of
                a work together under a single identity.<sup>[<a id="chapter-3-endnote-27" href="#ftn.chapter-3-endnote-27" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">151</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id605779" class="indexterm"/><a id="id605783" class="indexterm"/>The concept of identity for bibliographic resources was refined in the

                more abstract idea of an author’s intellectual or artistic creation. According to
                Lubetzky’s principle, an audio book, a video recording of a play, and an electronic
                book should be listed each as distinct items, yet still linked to the original

                Information components are the primitive and abstract resources in

                blocks of composite descriptions and other information artifacts.</p><p>The value creation processes in information-intensive domains work best when their

                vocabulary with a granularity and semantic precision compatible with the others. For
                example, the value created by a personal health record emerges when information from

                information.</p><p>This abstract definition of information components does not help identify them, so
                we will introduce some heuristic criteria: An <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">information component</span>”</span>
                can be (1) Any piece of information that has a unique label or identifier or (2) Any
                piece of information that is self-contained and comprehensible on its own.<sup>[<a id="chapter-3-endnote-30" href="#ftn.chapter-3-endnote-30" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">154</a>]</sup></p><p>These two criteria for determining the identity of information components are
                often easy to satisfy through observations, interviews, and task analysis because
                people naturally use many different types of information and talk easily about
                specific components and the documents that contain them. Some common components
                (e.g., person, location, date, item) and familiar document types (e.g., report,
                catalog, calendar, receipt) can be identified in almost any domain. Other components
                need to be more precisely defined to meet the more specific semantic requirements of
                narrower domains. These smaller or more fine-grained components might be viewed as
                refined or qualified versions of the generic components and document types, like
                course grade and semester components in academic transcripts, airport codes and
                flight numbers in travel itineraries and tickets, and drug names and dosages in
                prescriptions.</p><p>Decades of practical and theoretical effort in conceptual modeling, relational
                theory, and database design have resulted in rigorous methods for identifying
                information components when requirements and business rules for information can be
                precisely specified. For example, in the domain of business transactions, required
                information like item numbers, quantities, prices, payment information, and so on
                must be encoded as a particular type of data<span class="symbol">—</span>integer,
                decimal, Unicode string, etc.<span class="symbol">—</span> with clearly defined possible
                values and that follows clear occurrence rules.<sup>[<a id="chapter-3-endnote-31" href="#ftn.chapter-3-endnote-31" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">155</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id606491" class="indexterm"/>Identifying components can seem superficially easy at the transactional
                end of the Document Type Spectrum (see the Sidebar in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.2.1" title="Resource Domain">Resource Domain</a>), with orders or invoices, forms requiring data entry, or other highly-structured
                document types like product catalogs, where pieces of information are typically
                labeled and delimited by boxes, lines, white space or other presentation features
                that encode the distinctions between types of content. For example, the presence of
                ITEM, CUSTOMER NAME, ADDRESS, and PAYMENT INFORMATION labels on the fields of an
                online order form suggests these pieces of information are semantically distinct
                components in a retail application. They follow the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">self-contained and
                    comprehensible</span>”</span> heuristic enough to interconnect the order management,
                payment, and delivery services that work together to carry out the transaction. In
                addition, these labels might have analogues in variable names in the source code
                that implements the order form, or as tags in a <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> document
                created by the ordering application; <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;CustName&gt;</code>John Smith<code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/CustName&gt;</code> and <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;Item&gt;</code>A-19<code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/Item&gt;</code> in the
                order document can be easily identified when it is sent to the other services by the
                order management application.</p><p>But the theoretically grounded methods for identifying components like those of
                relational theory and <a id="id606631" class="indexterm"/>normalization that work for structured data do not strictly apply when
                information requirements are more qualitative and less precise at the narrative end
                of the Document Type Spectrum. These information requirements are typical of

                sources like those often found in law, education, and professional services.
                Narrative documents include technical publications, reports, policies, procedures
                and other less structured information, where semantic components are rarely labeled
                explicitly and are often surrounded by text that is more generic. Unlike
                transactional documents that depend on precise semantics because they are used by
                computers, narrative documents are used by people, who can ask if they aren’t sure
                what something means, so there is less need to explicitly define the meaning of the
                information components. Occasional exceptions, such as where components in narrative
                documents are identified with explicit labels like NOTE and WARNING, only prove the

                        can be thought of as a fixed or closed dictionary that includes all the

                    Controlled vocabularies are applied in many organizing systems, from

                    used and combined. Different domains can create specific controlled vocabularies
                    for their own purposes, but the important thing is that the vocabulary be used
                    consistently throughout that domain.<sup>[<a id="chapter-3-endnote-50" href="#ftn.chapter-3-endnote-50" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">174</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id608956" class="indexterm"/><a id="id608976" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_authority_control"/>For bibliographic resources

                    rules for handling prefixes, suffixes and other name parts that often cause name
                    variations. For example, a name like that of <span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Johann</span> <span class="othername">Wolfgang</span> <span class="surname">von Goëthe</span></span> might be alphabetized as both a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">G</span>”</span> name and a

                    interesting questions about what it means for a resource to stay the same over
                    time. One way to think of persistence is that a persistent resource is never
                    changed. However, physical resources often require maintenance, repair, or
                    restoration to keep them accessible and usable, and we might question whether at
                    some point these activities have transformed them into different
                        resources.<sup>[<a id="chapter-3-endnote-61" href="#ftn.chapter-3-endnote-61" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">185</a>]</sup> Likewise, digital resources require regular backup and migration to
                    keep them available and this might include changing their digital format.</p><p><a id="id610381" class="indexterm"/>We might instead think of persistence more abstractly, and expect that
                    persistent resources need only to remain functionally the same to support the
                    same interactions at any point in their lifetimes even if their physical
                    properties change. Active resources implemented as computational agents or web
                    services might be re-implemented numerous times, but as long as they don’t
                    change their interfaces they can be deemed to be persistent from the perspective
                    of any other resource that uses them. Similarly, many resources like online
                    newspapers or blog feeds continually change their content but still could have
                    persistent identifiers.</p><p>Some organizing systems closely monitor their resources and every interaction
                    with them to prevent or detect tampering with them or other unauthorized
                    changes. Some organizing systems, like those for software or legal documents,
                    explicitly maintain every changed version to satisfy expectations of persistence
                    because different users might not be relying on the same version. With digital
                    resources determining whether two resources are the same or determining how they
                    are related or derived from one another are very challenging problems.<sup>[<a id="chapter-3-endnote-62" href="#ftn.chapter-3-endnote-62" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">186</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Effectivity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-3.5.2">Effectivity</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id610500" class="indexterm"/><span><a id="def_effectivity"/>Many resources, or their properties, also

                    they come into effect at a particular time and will almost certainly cease to be
                    effective at some future date. Effectivity is sometimes known as time-to-live
                    and it is generally expressed as a range of two dates. It consists of a date on
                    which the resource is effective, and optionally a date on which the resource
                    ceases to be effective, or becomes stale.</span> For some types of resources,
                the effective date is the moment they are created, but for others, the effective
                date can be a time different from the moment of creation. For example, a law can be
                passed in November but not take effect until January 1 of the following year. An
                    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">effective date</span>”</span> is the counterpart of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Best
                    Before</span>”</span> date on perishable goods. That date indicates when a product goes
                bad, whereas an item’s effective date is when it <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">goes good</span>”</span> and the
                resource that it supersedes needs to be disposed of or archived.</p><p><a id="id610567" class="indexterm"/>Effectivity concerns sometimes intersect with name authority control, because name
                changes for resources often are tied to particular dates and events. Some places
                that have been the site of civil unrest, foreign occupation, and other political
                disruptions have had many different names over time. Even if you always live in the

                        information components that have minimal redundancy and ambiguity. Imagine

                        city, state and zip code into a large unstructured field rather than
                        separating them as atomic components of different types of information with
                        potentially varying uses. Similar redundancy exists for the products and
                        prices. Canceling an order might result in the business deleting all the

                        predictive modeling to make optimal use of the data. In designing smart
                        things and devices for people, it is helpful to create a smart model in
                        order to predict the kinds of patterns and locations relevant to the data
                        collected or monitored. These allow designers to develop a set of dimensions
                        and principles that will act as smart guides for the development of smart
                        things. Modeling helps to enable automation, security, or energy efficiency,
                        and baseline models can be used to detect anomalies. As for location, exact
                        locations are unnecessary; use of a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">symbolic space</span>”</span> to
