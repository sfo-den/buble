                    intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions they
                    support.</span></span>”</span> An organizing system emerges as the result of
            decisions about <span class="bold"><strong>what</strong></span> is organized, <span class="bold"><strong>why</strong></span> it is organized, <span class="bold"><strong>how
                much</strong></span> it is organized, <span class="bold"><strong>when</strong></span> it is
            organized, and <span class="bold"><strong>how or by whom</strong></span> it is organized. These
            decisions and the tradeoffs they embody are manifested in the four common activities of
            organizing systems<span class="symbol">—</span>selecting resources, organizing them,
            designing and supporting interactions with them, 
            and maintaining them<span class="symbol">—</span>which we described in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter 2</a>. Chapters 3-9 progressively explained each of the parts of the
            organizing system: resources, resource descriptions, resource categories and
            collections, and interactions with resources<span class="symbol">—</span>introducing
            additional concepts and methods associated with each of these parts.</p><p>Along the way we described many types of organizing systems. Sometimes we discussed
            broad categories of organizing systems like those for libraries, museums, business
            information systems, and compositions of web-based services. At other times we described
            specific instances of organizing systems like those in the <span class="application">Seed
                Library</span>, the <span class="application">Flickr photo sharing site</span>,
                <span class="application">Amazon.com’s drop shipment store</span>, and your home kitchen
            or closet.</p><p>We can now build on the foundation created by Chapters 1-9 to create a “roadmap” that
            organizes and summarizes the design issues and choices that emerge during an organizing
            system’s lifecycle. These design choices follow patterns that help us understand
            existing organizing systems better while also suggesting how to invent new ones by
            making a different set of design choices.</p><p>The roadmap is extensively annotated with references to the preceding chapters where
            the issues and choices mentioned in the roadmap were introduced and discussed in detail.
            We use this roadmap to analyze a variety of case study examples and to explore the
            “design neighborhood” around each of them. The five design questions from <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Foundations for Organizing Systems">Chapter 1</a> serve as a template to give each case study
            the same structure, which we hope enables instructors, students, and others who read
            this book to add to this collection of case studies by contributing their own at <a class="ulink" href="http://DisciplineOfOrganizing.org" target="_top"><code class="uri">DisciplineOfOrganizing.org</code></a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Organizing System Lifecycle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-10.2">The Organizing System Lifecycle</h2></div></div></div><p>System lifecycle models exhibit great variety; for our purposes it suffices to use a
            generic four-phase model that distinguishes a domain definition and scoping phase, a
            requirements phase, a design and implementation phase, and an operational and
            maintenance phase. These phases are brief and mostly inseparable for some simple
            organizing systems, more sequential for others, and more systematic and iterative for
            complex organizing systems.</p><p>Most of the specific decisions that must be made for an organizing system are strongly
            shaped by the initial decisions about its domain, scope (the breadth or variety of the
            resources), and scale (the number of resource instances). In organizing systems with
            limited scope and scale most of these decisions are made in an informal, unanalyzed, and
            holistic manner. For example, when we arrange our bookshelves or closets it is not
            necessary to think explicitly about scoping, requirements, design, implementation and
            operational phases. For complex organizing systems, however, especially those in
            information-intensive domains, it is important to follow a more systematic methodology.
            More careful attention to scope and requirements during the design and implementation
            phases is essential because the initial decisions can create lasting technology and
            process legacies that impact operational efficiency and flexibility.</p><p>The technical, social, business, and legal contexts in which the organizing system
            must operate (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#section-9.2.3" title="Socio-Political and Organizational Constraints">Socio-Political and Organizational Constraints</a>) also shape these
            decisions, as does the context created by other organizing systems in the same or
            related domains.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-10.3">Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain</h2></div></div></div><p>The most fundamental decision for an organizing system is defining its domain, the set
            or type of resources that are being organized. This is why “What is Being Organized?”
                (<a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3.2" title="What Is Being Organized?">What Is Being Organized?</a>) was the first of the five design
            decisions we introduced in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Foundations for Organizing Systems">Chapter 1</a>.</p><p>We refine how we think about an organizing system domain by breaking it
            down into five interrelated aspects: (1) the scope and scale of the collection, (2) the
            number and nature of users, (3) the time span or lifetime over which the organizing
            system will operate, (4) the physical or technological environment in which the
            organizing system is situated, and (5) the relationship of the organizing system to
            other ones that overlap with it in domain or scope. Answering these questions is a
            prerequisite for prioritizing requirements for the organizing system, proposing the
            principles of its design, and implementing the organizing system.</p><div class="sect2" title="Scope and Scale of the Collection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.3.1">Scope and Scale of the Collection</h3></div></div></div><p>The scope of a collection is the dominant factor in the design of an organizing
                system because it largely determines the extent and complexity of the resource
                descriptions needed by organizing principles and interactions (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.1.3" title="Scope, Scale, and Resource Description">Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</a>). The impact of broad scope arises
                more from the heterogeneity of the resources in a collection rather than from its
                absolute scale. It takes more effort to manage a broad and large collection than a
                narrow and small one. However, it takes less effort to manage a large collection if
                it has a narrow scope.</p><p>Consider a business information system being designed to contain millions of
                highly structured and similar instances of a small number of related resource types,
                like orders and their corresponding invoices.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-1" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-1" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">543</a>]</sup> The analysis to determine the appropriate properties and principles for
                resource description and organization is straightforward, and any order or invoice
                is an equally good instance to study.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-2" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-2" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">544</a>]</sup></p><p>Contrast this large but very narrow collection with a small but very broad one
                that contains a thousand highly variable instances of dozens of different resource
                types. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to determine if an instance is
                representative of its resource type, and every resource might need to be analyzed.
                This variability implies a large and diverse set of resource descriptions where
                individual resource instances might not be described with much precision because it
                costs too much to do it manually (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.6.1" title="Resource Description by Professionals">Resource Description by Professionals</a>). We can extrapolate to understand why organizing systems whose resource
                collections are both broad and deep, like those of
                    <span class="application">Amazon.com</span> or <span class="application">eBay</span>, have
                come to rely on machine learning techniques to identify description properties and
                construct resource taxonomies (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.6.4" title="Computational and Automated Resource Description">Computational and Automated Resource Description</a>,
                    <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.5.2" title="Implementing Categories That Do Not Conform to the Classical Theory">Implementing Categories That Do Not Conform to the Classical Theory</a>).<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-3" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-3" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">545</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id670295" class="indexterm"/>A partial remedy or compromise when the resource instances are highly dissimilar
                is to define resource types more broadly or abstractly, reducing the overall number
                of types. We illustrated this approach in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.2.2.1" title="Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme">Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme</a> when we contrasted how kitchen goods might be categorized
                broadly in a department store but much more precisely in a wholesale kitchen supply
                store. <a id="id670323" class="indexterm"/>The broader categories in the department store blur many of the differences
                between instances but in doing so yield a small set of common properties that can be
                used to describe them. Because these common properties will be at a higher level of
                abstraction, using them to describe resources will require less expertise and
                probably less effort (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.1.3" title="Scope, Scale, and Resource Description">Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.4.1" title="Category Abstraction and Granularity">Category Abstraction and Granularity</a>). However, this comes at a cost:
                Poets, painters, composers, sculptors, technical writers, and programmers all create
                resources, but describing all of them with a “creator” property as the Dublin Core
                requires loses a great deal of precision.</p><p><a id="id670380" class="indexterm"/>Challenges caused by the scale of a collection are often related to constraints
                imposed by the physical or technological environment in which the collection exists
                that limit how large the collection can be or how it can be organized (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.3.1" title="Organizing Physical Resources">Organizing Physical Resources</a>). Only a few dozen books can fit on
                a small bookshelf but thousands of books can fit in your two-car garage, which is a
                typical size because most people and families don’t have more than two cars. On the
                other hand, if you are a Hollywood mogul, superstar athlete, or sultan with a
                collection of hundreds of cars, a two-car garage is orders of magnitudes too small
                to store your collection.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-4" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-4" class="footnote">546</a>]</sup> Even collections of digital things can be limited in size by their
                technological environment, which you might have discovered when you ran out of space
                for your songs and photos on your portable media player.</p><p>Estimating the ultimate size of a collection at the beginning of an organizing
                system’s lifecycle can reduce scaling issues related to storage space for the
                resources or for their descriptions. Other problems of scale are more fundamental.
                Larger collections need more people to organize and maintain them, creating
                communication and coordination problems that grow much faster than the collection,
                especially when the collection is distributed in different locations.</p><p><a id="id670394" class="indexterm"/>The best way to prevent problems of scope and scale is through
                standardization. Standardization of resources can take place if they are created by
                automated means so that every instance conforms to a schema or model (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.5.1" title="Implementing Classical Categories">Implementing Classical Categories</a>).<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-5" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-5" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">547</a>]</sup> Standards for describing bibliographic resources enable libraries to
                centralize and share much resource description, and using the same standards for
                resources of diverse types helps address the challenge of broad scope by reducing
                the need for close monitoring and coordination. Analogous standards for describing
                information resources, services, or economic activities business, governmental, or
                scientific information systems to systematically manage hundreds of millions or even
                billions of transactional records or pieces of data (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.1.3" title="Scope, Scale, and Resource Description">Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Number and Nature of Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.3.2">Number and Nature of Users</h3></div></div></div><p>An organizing system might have only one user, as when an individual creates and
                operates an organizing system for a clothes closet, a home bookcase or file cabinet,
                or for digital files and applications on a personal computer or smart phone.
                Collections of personal resources are often organized for highly individualized
                interactions using <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span> categories that are hard to
                understand for any other user (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.2.2" title="Individual Categories">Individual Categories</a>).
                Personal collections or collections used by only a small number of people typically
                contain resources that they themselves selected, which makes the most typical
                interaction with the organizing system searching for a familiar known resource
                    (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#section-9.2.1" title="User Requirements">User Requirements</a>).</p><p>At the other extreme, an organizing system can have national or even global scope
                and have millions or more users like the Library of Congress classification system,
                the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code, or the Internet Domain Name
                System. These organizing systems employ systems of institutional categories (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.2.3" title="Institutional Categories">Institutional Categories</a>) that are designed to support
                systematically specified and purposeful interactions, often to search for previously
                unknown resources. In between these extremes are the many kinds of organizing
                systems created by informal and formal groups, by firms of every size, and by sets
                of cooperating enterprises like those that carry out supply chains and other
                information-intensive business processes.</p><p>The nature and number of users strongly shapes the contents of an organizing
                system and the interactions it must be designed to support (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#section-9.2.1" title="User Requirements">User Requirements</a>). Some generic categories of users that apply in many
                domains are customers, clients, visitors, operators, and managers. We can adapt the
                generic interactions supported by most organizing systems (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.2" title="Determining the Purposes">Determining the Purposes</a>) to satisfy these generic user types. For example,
                while most organizing systems allow any type of user to browse or search the
                collection to discover its content, only operators or managers are likely to have
                access to information about the browsing and searching activities of customers,
                clients, or visitors.</p><p>Once we have identified the organizing system’s domain more precisely we can
                refine these generic user categories, classifying users and interactions with more
                precision. For example, the customers of university libraries are mostly professors
                and students, while the customers of online stores are mostly shoppers seeking to
                find something to purchase.</p><p>Just as it is with collection scope, the heterogeneity of the user base is more
                critical than its absolute size. An airport bookstore typically has a narrowly
                focused collection and treats its customers as generic travelers browsing
                imprecisely for something to fill their time in the terminal or on the airplane. In
                contrast, the local public library will have a much broader collection because it
                has to meet the needs of a more diverse user base than the airport bookstore, and it
                will support a range of interactions and services targeted to children learning to
                read, school students, local businesses, retirees, and other categories of users. A
                company library will focus its collection on its industry segment, making it
                narrower in coverage than a local or university research library, but it might
                provide specialized services for marketing, engineering, research, legal, or other
                departments of the firm.</p><p><a id="id670548" class="indexterm"/><a id="id670552" class="indexterm"/>Each category of users, and indeed each individual user, brings
                different experiences, goals, and biases into interactions with the organizing
                system. As a result, organizing systems in the same domain and with nominally the
                same scope can differ substantially in the resources they contain and the
                interactions they support if they have different categories of users. The library
                for the <span class="orgname">Centers for Disease Control</span> and the
                    <span class="application">WebMD</span> website both contain information about diseases
                and symptoms, but the former is primarily organized to support research in public
                health and the latter is organized for consumers trying to figure out why they are
                sick and how to get well. These contrasting purposes and targeted users are
                manifested in different classification systems and descriptive
                    vocabularies.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-6" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-6" class="footnote">548</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Expected Lifetime of the Resources and of the Organizing System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.3.3">Expected Lifetime of the Resources and of the Organizing System</h3></div></div></div><p>The scope and scale of a collection and the size of its user population are often
                correlated with the expected lifetime of its organizing system. Because small
                personal organizing systems are often created in response to a specific situation or
                to accomplish a specific task, they generally have short lifetimes (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.2.2" title="Individual Categories">Individual Categories</a>).</p><p>The expected lifetime of the organizing system is not the same as the expected
                lifetime of the resources it contains because motivations for maintaining resources
                differ a great deal (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.5.1" title="Motivations for Maintaining Resources">Motivations for Maintaining Resources</a>). As we have
                just noted, some organizing systems created by individuals are tied to specific
                short-term tasks, and when the task is completed or changes, the organizing system
                is no longer needed or must be superseded by a new one. At the other extreme are
                libraries, museums, archives, and other memory institutions designed to last
                indefinitely because they exist to preserve valuable and often irreplaceable
                resources.</p><p>However, most business organizing systems contain relatively short-lived resources
                that arise from and support day-to-day operations, in which case the organizing
                system has a long expected lifetime with impermanent resources. Finally, just to
                complete our 2 x 2 matrix, the auction catalog that organizes valuable paintings or
                other collectibles is a short-lived single-purpose organizing system whose contents
                are descriptions of resources with long expected lifetimes.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Physical or Technological Environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.3.4">Physical or Technological Environment</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id670700" class="indexterm"/><span>An organizing system is often tied to a particular physical or
                    technological environment.</span> A kitchen, closet, card cabinet, airplane
                cockpit, handheld computer or smartphone, and any other physical environment in
                which resources are organized provides affordances to be taken advantage of and
                constraints that must be accommodated by an organizing system (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.1" title="Affordance and Capability">Affordance and Capability</a>).<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-7" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-7" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">549</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id670841" class="indexterm"/>The extent of these physical and technological constraints affects the lifetime of
                an organizing system because they make it more difficult to adapt to changes in the
                set of resources being organized or the reasons for their organization. A desk or
                cabinet with fixed “pigeon holes” or drawers affords less flexible organization than
                a file cabinet or open shelves. A building with hard-walled offices constrains how
                people interact and collaborate more than an open floor plan with modular cubicles
                does. Business processes implemented in a monolithic enterprise software application
                are tightly coupled; those implemented as a choreography of loosely-coupled web
                services can often transparently substitute one service provider for another.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Relationship to Other Organizing Systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.3.5">Relationship to Other Organizing Systems</h3></div></div></div><p>The same domain or set of resources can have more than one organizing system, and
                one organizing system can contain multiple others. The organizing system for books
                in a library arranges books about cooking according to the Library of Congress or
                Dewey Decimal classifications and bookstores use the <abbr class="abbrev">BISAC</abbr> ones,
                mostly using cuisine as the primary factor (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.3" title="Bibliographic Classification">Bibliographic Classification</a>). In turn, cookbooks employ an organizing system for
                their recipes that arranges them by type of dish, main ingredient, or method of
                preparation. Within a cookbook, recipes might follow an organizing system that
                standardizes the order of their component parts like the description, ingredients,
                and preparation steps.</p><p><a id="id670911" class="indexterm"/>Sometimes these multiple organizing systems can be designed in coordination so
                they can function as a single hierarchical, or nested, organizing system in which it
                is possible to emphasize different levels depending on the user’s task or
                application. Most books and many documents have an internal structure with chapters
                and hierarchical headings that enable readers to understand smaller units of content
                in the context of larger ones (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#section-5.5.2" title="Structural Relationships within a Resource">Structural Relationships within a Resource</a>).
                Similarly, a collection of songs can be treated as an album and organized using that
                level of abstraction for the item, but each of those songs can also be treated as
                the unit of organization, especially when they are embodied in separate digital
                files.</p><p><a id="id671024" class="indexterm"/><a id="id671029" class="indexterm"/>Organizing systems overlap and intersect. People and enterprises
                routinely interact with many different organizing systems because what they do
                requires them to use resources in ways that cut across context, device, or
                application boundaries. Just consider how many different organizing systems we use
                as individuals for managing personal information like contacts, appointments, and
                messages. As company employees we create and organize information in email, document
                repositories, spreadsheets, and <abbr class="abbrev">CRM</abbr> and <abbr class="abbrev">ERP</abbr>
                systems. Now consider this at an institutional scale in the inter-enterprise
                interactions among the organizing systems of physicians, hospitals, medical labs,
                insurance companies, government agencies, and other parties involved in healthcare.
                Finally, think about web “mash-ups” and composite services.</p><p>We have come to expect that the boundaries between organizing systems are often
                arbitrary and that we should be able to merge or combine them when that would create
                additional value. It is surely impossible to anticipate all of these
                    <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span> or dynamic intersections of organizing
                systems, but it is surely necessary to recognize their inevitability, especially
                when the organizing systems contain digital information and are implemented using
                web architectures.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-10.4">Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System</h2></div></div></div><p>The two parts of the definition of an organizing system explicitly suggest two
            categories of requirements, those that specify the intentional arrangement of the
            resources and those that specify the interactions with the resources. These categories
            of requirements both depend on resource descriptions, which are implied by but not
            explicitly called out in the definition of an organizing system.</p><p>Because <span>description, arrangement, and interaction are interrelated</span> it
            is impossible to describe them separately without some redundancy. Nevertheless, in this
            book we have done that on purpose because taking different perspectives on organizing
            systems in Chapters 2-9 has enabled us to introduce a broad range of concepts, issues,
            and methods:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Every organizing system must enable users to interact with its collection of

            one with only a small number of users, you might think there is little reason to think
            explicitly about requirements. However, any project benefits from the discipline of
            being more systematic about its purposes and their priorities. In addition, being
            explicit about requirements enables traceability and impact analysis. Traceability means
            being able to relate an interaction or feature of a system to the requirement it
            satisfies; impact analysis runs the causal link between requirements and features in the
            opposite direction to assess what or who will be affected if requirements
                change.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-8" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-8" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">550</a>]</sup></p><div class="sect2" title="Requirements for Interactions in Organizing Systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.4.1">Requirements for Interactions in Organizing Systems</h3></div></div></div><p>When we describe interactions in a generic or broad way as we did in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter 2</a> we
                see that all organizing systems have some common interactions, but most of the time
                we want to pay attention to the more specific interactions that are designed to
                create value in a particular organizing system because of the kind of resources it
                contains (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.2" title="Interaction and Value Creation">Interaction and Value Creation</a>). The domain, scope, and
                scale of the organizing system determines which interactions are possible and which
                ones must be explicitly supported, but the priorities of different interactions are
                more often determined by decisions about intended users (<a class="xref" href="ch10.html#section-10.3.2" title="Number and Nature of Users">Number and Nature of Users</a>).</p><p><a id="id671228" class="indexterm"/><span class="Business">For most organizing systems other than personal
                    ones, the set of interactions that are implemented in an organizing system is
                    strongly determined by business model considerations, funding levels, or other
                    economic factors. For-profit firms often differentiate themselves by the number
                    and quality of the interactions they support with their resources, some by
                    supporting many of them and some by supporting a minimal number. This
                    differentiation is strongly shaped by and also shapes user preferences; some
                    people prefer self-service or unmediated interactions, while others prefer full
                    service and mediated interactions.</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-9" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-9" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">551</a>]</sup>

                    when their funding is reduced.</span><sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-10" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-10" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">552</a>]</sup></p><p>Some requirements for interactions come along with technology requirements, to
                have resources in a particular format, to conform to a particular specification or
                standard in order to operate in some technology environment, or to interoperate with
                other parties or their organizing systems.</p><p><a id="id671413" class="indexterm"/><a id="id671420" class="indexterm"/>An essential requirement in every organizing system is ensuring that the
                supported interactions can be discovered and invoked by their intended users. In
                organizing systems with physical resources, good designers enhance the inherent
                affordances of resources with navigation and orientation aids that direct users to
                points of interactions (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.1" title="Affordance and Capability">Affordance and Capability</a>). With
                digital resources and information-intensive organizing systems, interactions are not
                immediately perceivable, and poor design can create overly complicated user
                interfaces in which many interactions are never discovered and thus never
                used.</p><p>It is tricky to compare the overall capabilities of organizing systems in terms of
                the number of variety of their interactions because what matters more is how much
                value they create. Organizing systems with active resources can create value on
                their own without an explicit user interaction (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.2.3.2" title="Active or Operant Resources">Active or Operant Resources</a>). Other organizing systems exploit stored, computed, or
                contextual information to create value by eliminating the need for user interactions
                    (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.1" title="Affordance and Capability">Affordance and Capability</a>).<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-11" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-11" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">553</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Requirements about the Nature and Extent of Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.4.2">Requirements about the Nature and Extent of Resource Description</h3></div></div></div><p>Interactions with resources within an organizing system often depend on
                descriptions of individual resources or descriptions of the collections that contain
                them. In the bibliographic domain, generic or common interactions make use of
                descriptions that can be associated with almost any type of resource, such as the
                name, creator, and creation date.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-12" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-12" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">554</a>]</sup> <a id="id671585" class="indexterm"/><a id="id671589" class="indexterm"/>For example, any resource with a sortable name or identifier can be
                arranged alphabetically to enable it to be easily found, and any resource with a
                creation date can be discovered by a “what’s new” query to a resource
                collection.</p><p>Different types of resources must have differentiating properties, otherwise there
                would be no reason to distinguish them as different types. These resource properties
                can be recorded in the terms of a description language to support one or more
                interactions or to answer one or more questions. Simply put, choices about the
                nature and extent of resource description depend on which interactions or questions
                are most frequent or important (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.1.1" title="Describing Instances or Describing Collections">Describing Instances or Describing Collections</a>). If a particular property of a resource has no interactions that depend on it,
                there is no need to describe it. However, if an interaction depends on a description
                of a particular resource property, a missing description or one of inadequate
                precision and granularity means that the interaction will be impossible or
                inefficient to carry out because the resource will need to be further analyzed to
                create or extract the required description. <a id="id671551" class="indexterm"/>An <abbr class="abbrev">ISBN</abbr> is a sufficient description to find a book in a
                directory, but if the <abbr class="abbrev">ISBN</abbr> is the only description associated with
                the book you will not be able to tell who wrote it. <a id="id671654" class="indexterm"/> The tradeoffs imposed by the extent and timing of resource description
                have been a recurring theme in this book, with the tradeoff between recall and
                precision being the most salient (<a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.3.5" title="When Is It Being Organized?">When Is It Being Organized?</a>,

                useful ones, especially for information resources where the property of aboutness is
                critical but challenging to describe. For non-text information resources this
                problem is magnified because the content is often in a semantically opaque format
                that cannot usefully be analyzed by people.</p><p>Business strategy and economics strongly influence the extent of resource
                description. In many museums and archives there are not enough trained people and
                time to describe every pottery fragment or document, and many resources are
                described only at an aggregate level. In contrast, some people argue that the
                explosion of content in physical and digital form mandates significant investment in
                descriptions that facilitate resource discovery in a crowded marketplace.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-13" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-13" class="footnote">555</a>]</sup></p><p>Automated and computerized processes can create the resource descriptions in an
                organizing system and their use is primarily driven by scale (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.6.4" title="Computational and Automated Resource Description">Computational and Automated Resource Description</a>). Search engines index web pages
                and analyze their link structures because it would be impossible to treat the web as
                a traditional library and organize it by human effort. The benefits of digital
                cameras, video recorders, and similar devices would be far fewer if people had to
                manually identify and describe each resource when creating it. Instead, these
                devices can automatically assign some contextual metadata. Similarly, competitive
                pressures on vendors to provide real-time and context-sensitive information services
                mandate automated collection of contextual information like location from mobile
                phones, portable book readers and tablet computers.</p><p>We might seek some optimal degree of description given some set of requirements or
                purposes for an organizing system and some estimate of the organizing effort that
                could be applied; in practice this is elusive for two reasons, both relating to
                scope and scale. First, as the number of users of an organizing system increases, it
                becomes more difficult to identify and anticipate all its possible purposes and
                constraints it must satisfy. Even if most users share the goals for the organizing
                system, any particular user might have some additional specialized use for some
                attributes or relationships that would require more description to satisfy.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-14" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-14" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">556</a>]</sup></p><p>Second, even if it were possible to implement some optimal degree of description
                in a particular organizing system, we would still encounter problems when multiple
                organizing systems exist in the same domain or in domains that intersect across
                context, device, or application boundaries. Since organizing systems are designed
                and evolve to satisfy the specific requirements of their particular context,
                companies will often describe the same resources differently, which creates
                integration and interoperability problems when companies need to exchange and
                combine information resources(<a class="xref" href="ch09.html#section-9.3.2" title="Transforming Resources for Interactions">Transforming Resources for Interactions</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Requirements about Intentional Arrangement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.4.3">Requirements about Intentional Arrangement</h3></div></div></div><p>Organizing principles depend on resource descriptions, so requirements for the
                former are always intertwined with those for the latter. Specifying requirements for
                the intentional arrangement of resources is analogous to specifying why and how
                resource categories can be created (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.3" title="Principles for Creating Categories">Principles for Creating Categories</a>). In turn, the creation of resource categories often becomes a question about the
                number and kind of resource properties that might be analyzed and exploited by
                organizing principles.</p><p><a id="id671788" class="indexterm"/><a id="id671690" class="indexterm"/><a id="id671742" class="indexterm"/><a id="id671772" class="indexterm"/>We noted that there is a continuum of category formation that ranges
                from minimal use of resource properties to more rigorous use of multiple properties,
                and finally to statistical or composite use of multiple properties, some of which
                are induced or inferred rather than explicit. The simplest principle for defining a
                category is by enumeration, just putting the resources into a set without any
                specification of any properties they might share. The enumerated resources might
                very well have common properties, but the principle of enumeration ignores them; the
                only property that matters for that principle is that the resources are in the same
                set. This corresponds to the simplest principle of intentional arrangement, that of
                collocation, just putting the resources in the same location without any additional
                organization.</p><p>Collocated resources often acquire some additional arrangement as a result of
                their use; consider how the books, papers, or other resources gathered for some
                writing project often end up in piles in your office or on your desk close to your
                work area. For a small collection, this proximity-to-use organizing principle is the
                easiest way to satisfy a requirement to minimize the time to find frequently used
                resources.</p><p>As we’ve often seen, the scope and scale of the organizing system is a dominant
                design consideration and it applies to principles of resource arrangement too. The
                collocation principle of arrangement is sufficient for small resource collections
                because it is not necessary to define the optimal organization if the time to find
                any particular resource is short even for an inefficient search method of scanning
                the entire collection. Using the extrinsic property of frequency of use makes search
                slightly more efficient, but only in organizing systems where the user population is
                small or interacts with the resources in similar ways. Otherwise, arranging
                resources to facilitate their frequent access for some users would hinder other
                users who never use them. Imagine if you shared your office desk with someone who
                works all night on other writing projects and leaves his frequently used resources
                in piles close to his work area – which becomes your work area in the
                morning.</p><p>Larger resource collections usually require multiple organizing principles to
                manage the complexity that emerges when more users and more varied interactions must
                be supported. It is essential to establish the priority of users and interactions
                because these requirements determine the order in which the principles are applied
                to arrange the resources. This ordering creates a logical resource hierarchy that
                affects the efficiency of interactions and the maintenance of the organizing system
                over time.</p><p>Information resources are invariably challenging to arrange because their
                aboutness is not an easily perceived property and because of the open-ended purposes
                they can serve. Information collections with broad scope most often use a standard
                system of bibliographic classification (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.3" title="Bibliographic Classification">Bibliographic Classification</a>). In contrast, special libraries have narrower
                collections that need to support domain-specific interactions for a relatively small
                set of users, and as a result they require more specialized organizational
                    schemes.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-15" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-15" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">557</a>]</sup> The principles for resource arrangement in large firms of every type are

                parties with different requirements, there is a potential for conflict. Roommates or
                spouses sometimes argue about how to organize items in the kitchen, in the
                refrigerator, or in some other shared space. To a person who arranges spices
                alphabetically and condiment jars by size, arranging them according to cuisine or
                frequency of use makes no sense. Similarly, if you are the sole user of a Dropbox or
                other cloud storage account, you can organize it any way you want. You can use any
                number of folders that need only make sense to you, or you can leave everything
                unorganized in a single folder. However, if you share the Dropbox account with
                another person, they are likely to have different organizational needs or
                preferences. Perhaps you tend to organize resources by file type, while they prefer
                to organize resources by topic or project.</p><p>A small number of people can often agree on an organizing system that meets the
                needs of each participant through informal negotiations. The potential for conflict
                increases when more people are involved, and “bottom-up” <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
                    hoc</em></span> negotiations to resolve every disagreement between every
                pair of participants just aren’t feasible. In many domains conflicts are avoided or
                suppressed because the parties have developed or agreed to conform to standards
                    (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.1.5" title="Classification and Standardization">Classification and Standardization</a>). Nevertheless, conflicts in
                organizing principles for large-scale organizing systems are often resolved by
                parties with the legal authority or economic power to impose a solution on all the
                participants in a “top-down” manner.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-16" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-16" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">558</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Designing and Implementing an Organizing System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-10.5">Designing and Implementing an Organizing System</h2></div></div></div><p>Requirements define what must be done but NOT how to do it; that’s the role of the
            design and implementation phases. Being explicit about requirements and the intended
            scope and scale of an organizing system before moving onto these phases in an organizing
            system’s lifecycle avoids two problems. The first is taking a narrow and short-term
            focus on the initial resources in a collection, which might not be representative of the
            collection when it reaches its planned scope and scale. This can result in overly
            customized and inflexible resource descriptions or arrangements that cannot easily
            accommodate the future growth of the collection. A second problem, often a corollary of
            the first, is not separating design principles from their implementation in some
            specific environment or technology.</p><div class="sect2" title="Choosing Scope- and Scale-Appropriate Technology"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.5.1">Choosing Scope- and Scale-Appropriate Technology</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id672192" class="indexterm"/>A simple organizing system to satisfy personal record keeping or some short-lived
                information management requirements can be implemented using folders and files on a
                personal computer or by using “off the shelf” generic software such as web forms,
                spreadsheets, databases, and wikis. Other simple organizing systems run as
                applications on smart phones. Some small amount of configuration, scripting,
                structuring or programming might be involved, but in many cases this work can be
                done in an <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hoc</em></span> manner. The low initial cost to get
                started with these kinds of applications must be weighed against the possible cost
                of having to redo a lot of the work later because the resources and the resource
                descriptions might not be easily exported to new ones.</p><p>More capable organizing systems that enable the persistent storage and efficient
                retrieval of large amounts of structured information resources generally require
                additional design and implementation efforts. Flat word processing files and
                spreadsheets are not adequate. Instead, XML document models and database schemas
                often must be developed to ensure more control of and validation of the information
                content and its descriptions. Software for version and configuration management,
                security and access control, query and transformation, and for other functions and
                services must also be developed to implement the organizing system.</p><p><a id="id672208" class="indexterm"/><a id="id672214" class="indexterm"/>Technology for organizing systems will always evolve to enable new
                capabilities. For example, cloud computing and storage are radically changing the
                scale of organizing systems and the accessibility of the information they contain.
                It might be possible to implement these capabilities and services to an organizing
                system in an incremental fashion with informal design and implementation methods. If
                information models, processing logic, business rules and other constraints are
                encoded in the software without explicit traceability to requirements and design
                decisions the organizing system will be difficult to maintain if the context, scope
                or requirements change. This is why we have repeatedly emphasized the importance of
                architectural thinking about organizing systems, beginning in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#section-1.2.3.1" title="The Concept of “Organizing Principle”">The Concept of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Organizing Principle</span>”</span></a> where we proposed that organizing
                principles should ideally be expressed in a way that did not assume how they would
                be implemented (See also <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.3.2.2" title="“Information Architecture” and Organizing Systems"><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Information Architecture</span>”</span> and Organizing Systems</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.1.3" title="Classification vs. Physical Arrangement">Classification vs. Physical Arrangement</a>, and <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#section-8.1" title="Introduction">Introduction</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Architectural Thinking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.5.2">Architectural Thinking</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id672295" class="indexterm"/>Architectural thinking 
                leads to more modularity and abstraction in design, making
                it easier to change an implementation to satisfy new requirements or to take
                advantage of new technologies or procedures. It is also important to think
                architecturally about the design of the vocabularies and schemas for resource
                description and of classification systems to leave room for expansion to accommodate
                new resource types (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#section-6.5" title="Implementing Categories">Implementing Categories</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.2.2.3" title="Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time">Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time</a>). Doing so is easier if the
                descriptions are logically and physically distinct from the resources they
                describe.</p><p><a id="id672334" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Nevertheless, architectural thinking requires more careful analysis of resources
                and implementation alternatives, and most people don’t think this way, especially
                for personal and informal organizing systems. You can imagine that someone might
                arrange a collection of paperback books in a small bookcase whose shelf height and
                width were perfectly suited for the paperbacks they currently own. However, this
                organizing system would not work at all for large format books, and a paperback
                could not be added to the collection unless one was purged from the collection. It
                would be more sensible to start with a bigger bookcase with adjustable shelves so
                that the organizing system would have a longer lifetime.</p><p><a id="id672313" class="indexterm"/></p><p>You might think that large institutional organizing systems would avoid these
                problems caused by tying a collection too tightly to the physical environment in
                which it is initially organized, but sometimes they don’t. A famous example involves
                the art collection of the Barnes Foundation, which had to keep its paintings in the
                exact same crowded arrangements when the museum made a controversial move from a
                small building to a larger one because the donor had mandated that the paintings
                never be moved from their original settings.

                    for gonorrhea and who then amassed perhaps the greatest private art collection
                    ever, one that contained over 800 paintings by artists like <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Picasso</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Renoir</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Matisse</span></span>, <span class="personname"><span class="surname">van Gogh</span></span>, and <span class="personname"><span class="surname">Cezanne</span></span>. In 1922 Barnes built a museum for his collection in his
                    residential neighborhood in Merion, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. Barnes did not
                    open his collection to the public and in his will mandated that the collection
                    never be moved, loaned, or sold.</p><p>In the decades after Barnes died in 1951 the Merion museum needed extensive
                    repairs and security upgrades, and some people suggested that its remote
                    location and access restrictions jeopardized its financial viability. However, a
                    proposal to relocate the collection to Philadelphia seemingly violated the terms
                    of the Barnes will.</p><p>A legal fight dragged on for decades. Finally in 2004 a judge ruled that the
                    collection could be moved to Philadelphia, but only if the new museum contained
                    exact copies of the gallery rooms of the original museum and arranged the
                    paintings exactly as they were in Merion. The new museum building, opened in
                    2012, is ten times larger than thae old one, but the collection takes up the
                    same space as it did in Merion. The other 90% of the building is occupied by an
                    auditorium, offices, classrooms, a gift shop, and other space that contains none
                    of the collection.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-17" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-17" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">560</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Distinguishing Access to Resources from Resource Control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.5.3">Distinguishing Access to Resources from Resource Control</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="id672529" class="indexterm"/><a id="id672573" class="indexterm"/>Because large resource collections are often used for multiple purposes by many
                different people or projects, they illustrate another important architectural issue
                for collections of digital resources. A requirement for access to resources does not
                imply a need to directly own or control them, and information-intensive and
                web-based businesses have increasingly adopted organizing system designs that
                involve storage of digital resources in the cloud, licensing of globally distributed
                resources, and outsourcing of information services. Designs that use these
                architectural concepts can realize functional and quality improvements because the
                location and identity of the service provider is hidden by an abstraction layer
                    (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.4.2.1" title="Value Creation with Physical Resources">Value Creation with Physical Resources</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#section-3.4.3.5" title="Distinguish Identifying and Resolving">Distinguish Identifying and Resolving</a>). However, separating access from ownership has been
                a cultural challenge for some libraries and museums whose institutional identities
                emphasize the resources they directly control and the physical buildings in which
                they control them.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-19" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-19" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">561</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Standardization and Legacy Considerations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.5.4">Standardization and Legacy Considerations</h3></div></div></div><p>As we noted with the Barnes Collection, a building becomes old and outdated over
                time. The technology used in digital organizing systems becomes obsolete faster than
                physical buildings do. The best way to slow the inevitable transformation of today’s
                cutting edge technology to tomorrow’s legacy technology is to design with standard
                data formats, description vocabularies and schemas, and classification systems
                unless you have specific requirements that preclude these choices.</p><p><a id="id672658" class="indexterm"/>Even a requirement to interoperate with an organizing system that uses
                proprietary or non-standard specifications can usually be satisfied by transforming
                from a standard format (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.1.5.2" title="Institutional Semantics">Institutional Semantics</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#section-9.2.3" title="Socio-Political and Organizational Constraints">Socio-Political and Organizational Constraints</a>). Similarly, it is better to design
                the <abbr class="abbrev">API</abbr>s and data feeds of an organizing system in a generic or
                standard way that abstracts from their hidden implementation. This design principle
                makes it easier for external users to understand the supported interactions, and
                also prevents disclosure of any aspects of resource description or organization that
                provide competitive advantage. For example, the way in which a business classifies
                products, suppliers, customers, or employees can be competitively important.</p><p><a id="id672719" class="indexterm"/>Two important design questions that arise with data transformation or conversion,
                whether it is required by a technology upgrade or an interoperability requirement,
                are when to do it and where to do it. The job of converting all the resources in a
                collection can typically be outsourced to a firm that specializes in format
                conversion or resource description, and a batch or pre-emptive conversion of an
                entire collection enables an upgraded or new organizing system to operate more
                efficiently when it is not distracted by ongoing conversion activity. On the other
                hand, if resources vary greatly in their frequency of use, a “do-it-yourself
                on-demand” method is probably more cost effective as long as the conversion does not
                impact the interactions that need to be supported.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-10.6">Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System</h2></div></div></div><p>After the organizing system has been designed and implemented it can be put into its
            operation and maintenance phases. We will look at these from two perspectives, first
            from the point of view of individual resources, and then from the point of view of the
            organizing system’s design and implementation. These two perspectives are not always
            clearly distinguished. Curation, for example, is often used to describe actions taken to
            maintain individual resources as well as those that result in new arrangements of
            them.</p><div class="sect2" title="Maintaining an Organizing System: Resource Perspective"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.6.1">Maintaining an Organizing System: Resource Perspective</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes an organizing system is implemented with its organizing structures and
                relationships waiting to be populated by resources as they are acquired and
                described. The scope and scale of the organizing system shapes how the descriptions
                are created and how the descriptions are then used to assign resources to the
                logical or physical containers of the organizing system. The most important
                decisions to be made at this point involve determining an appropriate mix of methods
                for creating the resource descriptions, because their cost, quality, consistency,
                completeness, and semantic richness depends on which human or computational agents
                do the work (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.6" title="Creating Resource Descriptions">Creating Resource Descriptions</a>).</p><p>For web-based and consumer-focused organizing systems, it is tempting to rely on
                users to assign descriptions, tags, or ratings to resources (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.2.2.3" title="Tagging of Web-Based Resources">Tagging of Web-Based Resources</a>). Some of these systems attempt to
                improve the quality and precision of these descriptions by providing forms,
                controlled vocabularies, or suggestions. Finding a balance is tricky; too much
                direction and control is demotivating to uncompensated volunteer describers, and too
                little of it results in the proverbial <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tag soup.</span>”</span></p><p>An essential operational and maintenance activity is evaluation of resource
                descriptions, first with respect to the time and process by which they are created,
                and second with respect to how when they support the designed interactions (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#section-4.3.7" title="Evaluating Resource Descriptions">Evaluating Resource Descriptions</a>).</p><p>Some organizing systems are initiated with a fixed set of resources that will not
                change in any way. For example, in an archive as most narrowly defined, neither the
                individual resources nor the organization of the collection as a whole will change.
                If an archive of Abraham Lincoln letters is established, we know that Lincoln will
                never revise any letters or write any new ones, and any new classifications or
                descriptions devised by people studying the archive will not be used to rearrange
                the letters.</p><p>Most organizing systems, however, need to support ongoing interactions with a
                collection that changes over time as new resources enter the collection and old ones
                leave. These selection and collection management processes are explicit in
                libraries, museums and similar institutions that maintain collections to satisfy the
                changing needs and preferences of their user communities (<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#section-2.2.2" title="Selection Principles">Selection Principles</a>).</p><p><a id="id672811" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Maintaining an Organizing System: Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.6.2">Maintaining an Organizing System: Properties, Principles and Technology
                Perspective</h3></div></div></div><p>It is useful to consider how an organizing system as a whole is operated and
                maintained over time. We can analyze how the system’s organizing properties,
                principles and technology might change, and we can roughly order different types of
                change according to their overall impact.</p><p>The most predictable maintenance activities for an organizing system with an
                expected long lifetime (<a class="xref" href="ch10.html#section-10.3.3" title="Expected Lifetime of the Resources and of the Organizing System">Expected Lifetime of the Resources and of the Organizing System</a>) are
                incremental changes in description vocabularies and classification schemes (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.2.2.3" title="Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time">Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time</a>). These need to evolve when new
                instances or contexts require additional properties to maintain the distinctions
                between types of resources, but the basic principles embodied in the organizing
                systems are not affected.</p><p>Incremental category maintenance takes place even in personal organizing systems
                where the categories are not always explicit. The collection of clothes in a college
                student’s closet and the categories and properties for arranging them will change
                somewhat when he graduates and takes a job in a downtown office building where he
                needs to dress more formally than he did as a student. He will learn that despite
                the common term in the category name, “student casual” and “business casual” do not
                contain the same sets of resources.</p><p>Category maintenance is an ongoing activity in institutional organizing systems.
                The most commonly used bibliographic classification systems all have numbering and
                naming schemes that allow for subdivision and extension to create new subcategories
                to accommodate resources about new fields of knowledge and technology.</p><p><a id="id672832" class="indexterm"/><a id="id672976" class="indexterm"/>As another example, the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="orgname">Association for Computing
                        Machinery</span></span>(ACM)</span> professional society created a keyword classification in 1964 to
                organize articles in its many publications, but relentless change in the computing
                field driven by Moore’s Law has required the <abbr class="abbrev">ACM</abbr> to significantly
                revise the system almost every decade.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-20" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-20" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">562</a>]</sup></p><p>In contrast, changes in business organizing systems are more likely to be driven
                by economic factors. Resource properties for managing collections of resource and
                the information that describes them often change over time as a result of new
                products and services, mergers and acquisitions, or refined customer segmentation.
                More substantial changes in business organizing systems reflect the need to comply
                with laws and regulations that impose new requirements for tracing money flows or
                transactions. These mandated classifications and processes might require new
                organizing principles, not just incremental properties (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#section-7.1.5.4" title="Mandated Classifications">Mandated Classifications</a>).</p><p><a id="id673050" class="indexterm"/>The choice of implementation technology influences how easy it is to
                handle these types of changes in organizing systems. In databases this problem is
                known as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">schema migration.</span>”</span> With XML implementations, schemas can be designed with
                <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">extension</span>”</span> or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">codelist</span>”</span> elements to enable changes that will not invalidate
                existing information. Business processes that are driven by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">executable
                specifications</span>”</span> like the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">Business Process Execution Language</span>(BPEL)</span> can be easily modified because the <abbr class="abbrev">BPEL</abbr>
                <abbr class="abbrev">XML</abbr> instance is used to configure the software that carries out the
                process it describes.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-21" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-21" class="footnote">563</a>]</sup></p><p>Another very predictable type of activity over time with organizing systems is a
                technology upgrade that improves its quality or capabilities without affecting the
                organizing principles. A student might replace his handwritten lecture notes with
                typed notes on a laptop or tablet computer but not significantly change the way the
                notes are organized.</p><p><a id="id673101" class="indexterm"/>Institutional organizing systems are adopting tiered storage systems that
                automatically move resources between different types of storage media to meet
                performance, availability and recovery requirements. For example, firms with high
                financial impact of downtime like banks run critical organizing systems with copies
                in “failsafe” or “hot” modes that are synchronized with the production environments
                to prevent any interruptions in information access if the latter are disrupted. All
                the relevant resources are immediately available. On the other hand, resources
                needed for regulatory compliance can be kept on lower cost disk storage.</p><p>The most challenging kinds of maintenance activities for organizing systems
                involve changes to the principles for arranging resources along with changes in the
                implementing technology. An example is the ambitious effort to introduce semantic
                web and linked data concepts in bibliographic organizing systems (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html#section-5.8.2" title="Bibliographic Organizing Systems">Bibliographic Organizing Systems</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#section-8.4.3" title="The Semantic Web World">The Semantic Web World</a>). And change comes faster to businesses than to
                libraries and museums. New technologies can have a disruptive impact on business
                organizing system, forcing major changes to enable strategy changes that involve
                faster finding, retrieval, or delivery of informational or physical goods.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-22" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-22" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">564</a>]</sup></p><p>Sometimes these major changes to organizing principles and technologies can be
                introduced incrementally, with changes “rolled out” to different sets of resources
                or user groups during a transition period. However, sometimes the changes are
                inherently ‘”all or none” because it is impossible to have two conflicting
                organizing systems operating in the same context. An easy to understand example of
                an organizing system that changed radically is the system governing which side of
                the road you drive on, which was changed in Samoa in 2009.

                    road. The convention of driving on either the right side or the left side is a
                    legal standard that you, and others who share the road, take for granted.
                    However, you must follow it to ensure safe driving and avoid running into other
                    vehicles and pedestrians.</p><p>This standard of which side of the road you drive on, simple as it seems, was
                    not decided arbitrarily, but rather, it was adopted as a result of history,
                    convention, and the need for organization. If you were the only person in your
                    country to use the road, you could choose to travel on any side you wanted, even
                    travel right down the middle. As soon as more than one person needs to use the
                    same road, the risk of collisions compels the creation of a coordinating
                    standard.</p><p>In 2009, the government of Samoa took the rare step of changing the side of
                    the road standard from driving on the right to driving on the left. The original
                    standard reflected the influence of German colonization in the early 1900s.
                    However, Samoa is both geographically close to and economically intertwined with
                    Australia and New Zealand, former British colonies that follow the British
                    convention of driving on the left side. This proximity gives Samoa access to a
                    nearby source of used cars that would be attractive to Samoa’s relatively poor
                    population. So, the Samoan government decided to use its authority to change the
                    driving standard so that more of its people could afford to buy cars.</p><p>As one could imagine, this decision was not implemented without controversy
                    and opposition. While the decision benefited people currently without cars, it
                    negatively affected those who already owned them. After a switch like this, what
                    happens to the current market value of the thousands of cars designed to drive
                    on the right? Opponents also claimed that the switch would cause unprecedented
                    safety hazards. If even a small fraction of drivers were not able to immediately
                    get the hang of driving on the other side, the accident rate could increase
                    tremendously. Imagine the current pool of buses designed with doors that open on
                    the right hand side<span class="symbol">—</span>would they now let passengers out in
                    the middle of the street? Who would pay to have the buses modified to put doors
                    on the left hand side?<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-23" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-23" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">565</a>]</sup></p></div><p><a id="id673311" class="indexterm"/></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Applying the Roadmap: Organizing Systems Case Studies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-10.7">Applying the Roadmap: Organizing Systems Case Studies</h2></div></div></div><p>We now fulfill the promise of this chapter, and this book, with a set of case study

                and under his bed is a suitcase containing several photo albums with a few hundred
                photos. Some of them have captions, but many don’t. What do you do with them?</p><p>Your first thought was to create a digital photo archive of Grandpa’s collection
                so that you and all your relatives could see them, and you would also want to
                generate accurate captions where none exist. Since you have an extensive digital
                photo collection of your own in a web-based application perhaps you can combine the
                two collections to create a multigenerational photo organizing system.</p><p>This project involves digitization, archiving, social media issues, and
                negotiations with and collecting information from other family members who might
                have different views about what to do.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING ORGANIZED?</strong></span> It is easy to
                find advice about how to digitize old photos, but there are more choices than you
                might think. What resolution and format should you use? Should you do the work
                yourself or send Grandpa’s precious photos to a service and take the risk that they
                might get lost? Should you do any restoration or enhancement of the photos as part
                of the digitization process?<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-24" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-24" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">566</a>]</sup></p><p>More fundamental design questions concern the scope and scale of the organizing
                system. If you’re digitizing Grandpa’s photos and combining them with yours, you’re
                skipping a generation. Shouldn’t you also include photos from your parents and the
                rest of Grandpa’s children? That generation has both printed photos and digital
                ones, but it is not as comfortable with computers as you are, and their digital
                photos are stored less systematically on a variety of CD-ROM, DVDs, flash memory
                sticks, and SD photo cards, making the digitizing and organizing work more
                complicated. Do these differences in storage media reflect an intentional
                arrangement that needs to be preserved? And what about that box full of Super 8
                cartridges and VHS tapes with family videos on them, and the audio cassettes with
                recordings made at long-ago family gatherings? </p><p>A family history management system that includes many different resource types is
                a much bigger project than the one you contemplated when you first opened Grandpa’s
                suitcase. It is easier to consider using separate but related organizing systems for
                each media type, because there are many web-based applications you could use. In
                fact, there are far too many choices of web applications for you to consider. You
                might compare some for their functionality and usability, but given that the long
                expected lifetime of your organizing system there are more critical considerations:
                whether the site is likely to last as long as your collection and if it doesn’t, how
                easily you can export your resources and resource descriptions.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-25" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-25" class="footnote">567</a>]</sup></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHY ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The overall goal
                of preserving Grandpa’s photos needs no justification, but is preservation the
                primary goal? Or is to enable access to the images for far-flung family members? Or
                is it to create a repository for family photos as they continue to be produced?
                Alternatively, is it less about the images themselves and perhaps more about
                collecting family-history information contained in the photos, thus making the
                collection of metadata (accurate information about when and where the photo was
                taken, who is in it, etc.) most important?</p><p>These decisions determine requirements for the interactions that the photo
                organizing system must support, but the repertoire of interactions is mostly
                determined by the choice of photo storage and sharing application. Some applications
                combine photo storage in a cloud-based repository tied to a very powerful set of
                digital photography tools, but this functionality comes with complexity that would
                overwhelm your less technology-savvy relatives. They would be happy just to be able
                to browse and search for photos.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>HOW MUCH ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> Because you
                realize that a carefully designed set of categories and a controlled tagging
                vocabulary will enable precise browsing and search, you chose an application that
                supports grouping and tagging. But not everyone should be allowed to group or tag
                photos, and maybe some of the more distant relatives can view photos but not add
                any.</p><p>Will your categories and tags include all of those that Grandpa used when he
                arranged pictures in albums and made notes on the back of many of them? Do you want
                to allow annotations? Maybe this is a picture from a vacation; if you go back to the
                same place, do you want to create an association between the pictures?</p><p>Don’t forget to keep Grandpa’s original albums in a safe place, not under a bed
                somewhere.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHEN ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> Once you create
                your categories and tags, you can require people to use them when they add new
                photos to the collection. Perhaps the existing resource descriptions can be
                completed or enhanced as a collective activity at a family reunion. Don’t put this
                off too long<span class="symbol">—</span>the people who can identify Grandpa’s sister
                Gladys, her second husband, and his sister in an uncaptioned photo are getting on in
                years.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHO DOES THE ORGANIZING?</strong></span> You have taken on the
                role of the editor and curator, but you can’t do everything and having a group of
                people involved will probably result in more robust organizing. A group can also
                better handle sticky situations like what to do if people get divorced or have a
                falling out with other family members; do pictures taken of or by them get
                deleted?</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.</strong></span> Maintenance of this
                collection for an indefinite time raises the important issue or a succession plan
                for the curator. If only one name is on the account and only that person knows the
                password, you run the risk of losing access to the photos if that person dies. One
                of Grandpa’s mistakes was dying without clearly specifying his intentions for his
                photo collection, so whatever you decide you should document carefully and include a
                continuity plan when you are no longer the curator.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-26" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-26" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">568</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Knowledge Management for a Small Consulting Firm"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.7.2">Knowledge Management for a Small Consulting Firm</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>OVERVIEW. </strong></span> A senior professor who has done
                part-time consulting for many years is very pleased when his latest book becomes a
                best-seller and he is inundated with new consulting opportunities. He decides to
                take a two-year leave of absence from his university to start a small consulting
                firm with several of his current and former graduate students as his junior
                consulting partners.</p><p>An organizing system for knowledge management is required, but what gets designed
                will depend on the scoping decision. Is the goal of the system to support the
                consulting business, or also to support ongoing and future research projects that
                sooner or later will generate the consulting opportunities? </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The professor
                concludes that since his consulting is based on his research, he needs to include in
                the new knowledge management system his research articles and the raw and analyzed
                data that is discussed in the articles. These resources are already organized to a
                great extent according to the research project that led to their creation. These
                have been kept in the professor’s university office.</p><p>The professor also has a separate collection of consulting proposals, client
                reports, and presentations that he has made at client firms. Because of restrictive
                university rules about faculty consulting, the professor has always kept these
                resources in his home office rather than on campus.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-27" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-27" class="footnote">569</a>]</sup></p><p>In addition to these existing resource types, it will be necessary to create new
                ones that make systematic and explicit information that the professor has managed in
                an informal and largely tacit manner. This includes consulting inquiries,
                information about prospects, and information about specific people in client
                firms.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHY ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The professor
                has usually just done one consulting project at a time, very opportunistically. He
                has often turned down projects that involved more work than he could do himself. He
                now sees the opportunity to do much more consulting and to take on more significant
                projects if he can leverage his expertise in a more efficient way.</p><p>The professor can take on the “rainmaker” role to secure new consulting
                engagements and make the important decisions, and he is confident that he can train
                and support his new staff of current and former students to do much of the actual
                consulting work.</p><p>The knowledge management system must enable everyone in the firm to access and
                contribute to project repositories that contain proposals, plans, work in progress,
                and project deliverables. Much of this work can be reused from one project to
                another, increasing the productivity of the firm and the quality of its
                    deliverables.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-28" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-28" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">570</a>]</sup></p><p>Just as it is essential that the professor’s knowledge is systematized and made
                available via a knowledge management system, so must the knowledge created by the
                new staff of consultants. The professor cannot expect that all of the students will
                work for him forever, so any knowledge that they acquire and create in the course of
                their work will be lost to the firm unless it is captured along with the
                professor’s.</p><p>The consulting firm probably won’t have an indefinite lifetime. After his leave of
                absence, the professor might return to his university duties, perhaps on a part-time
                basis. The knowledge management system will enable him to leave the firm in someone
                else’s hands while enabling him to keep tabs on and possibly contribute to ongoing
                projects. Alternatively, if the firm is doing very well, perhaps the professor will
                resign his university position and take on the role of growing the firm. A larger
                consultancy might want to acquire the professor’s firm, and the firm’s valuation
                will in part be determined be the extent to which the firm’s capabilities and
                resources are documented in the knowledge management system.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>HOW MUCH ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> A small
                firm has neither the money nor the people to invest in complex technology and a
                rigorous process for knowledge management, but appropriate technology is readily
                available and affordable. Decisions about organizing principles must be made that
                reflect the mix of consulting projects; resources might be organized in a shared
                file system by customer type, project type, by the lead consultant – or in all of
                these ways using a faceted classification approach.</p><p>Standard document templates and style sheets for the resource types created by
                consultants can be integrated into word processors and spreadsheets. Contact and
                customer management functionality can be licensed as a hosted application.</p><p>Many small teams make good use of wikis for knowledge management because they are
                very flexible in the amount of structure they impose.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-29" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-29" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">571</a>]</sup></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHEN ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The professor’s
                decision to take a leave of absence reflects his belief that getting the firm
                started quickly is essential if he is to capitalize on his recent bestselling book
                to generate consulting business. This makes managing the prospect pipeline and the
                proposal-writing process the highest priority targets for knowledge
                management.</p><p>Much of the other organizing work can emerge as adjuncts to consulting projects if
                some effort is made to coordinate the organizing across projects.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHO DOES THE ORGANIZING?</strong></span> Because many of the
                early organizing decisions have implications for the types of customers and projects
                that the firm can take on, only the professor is capable of making most of them. The
                principal goal of the knowledge management system is to enable the professor to
                delegate work to his consulting staff, so he needs to enlist them in the design of
                the organizing system to ensure it is effective.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.</strong></span> As the consulting firm
                grows, it is inevitable that some consultants will be better than others at creating
                and using knowledge to create customer value, and they will expect to be compensated
                accordingly. It is essential for the ongoing success of the firm not to let this
                create disincentives for knowledge capture and sharing between consultants. The
                solution is to develop a company culture that promotes and rewards them.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-30" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-30" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">572</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Japanese Farms Look to the Cloud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="section-10.7.3">Japanese Farms Look to the Cloud</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>OVERVIEW. </strong></span> Unlike the first two case studies,
                this is an actual case rather than a hypothetical or composite one. It shares with
                the first two cases a focus on preserving valuable resources but in the radically
                different domain of farming.</p><p>This case concerns an initiative by Fujitsu, a Japanese technology firm, to apply
                “smart computing” and lean manufacturing techniques to the agricultural sector,
                which lags in technology use. Fujitsu is testing a “farm work management system” at
                six Japanese farms. In this case study we will focus on the farm highlighted in a
                2011 <em class="citetitle">Wall Street Journal</em> story.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-31" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-31" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">573</a>]</sup></p><p>This test farm is located in southern Japan. It has 60 different crops spread over
                100 hectares (about 250 acres), an area slightly larger than the central campus of
                the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING ORGANIZED?</strong></span> Sensors are
                deployed in each of 300 different farm plots to collect readings on temperature,
                soil and moisture levels. Video cameras also monitor each plot.</p><p><a id="id673812" class="indexterm"/>The 72 relatively unskilled workers on the farm are also managed
                resources. Each of them carries a mobile phone for communication, for transmission
                of pictures, and for <abbr class="abbrev">GPS</abbr> tracking of their location.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHY ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The highest
                level goal for Fujitsu is to expand its reach as a technology firm by applying the
                concepts of lean manufacturing, statistical process control, and continual
                improvement to new domains. Farming is an obvious choice in Japan because it is a
                relatively unproductive sector where the average age is over 60. It is essential
                that farms use more computing capability to increase efficiency and to capture and
                reuse the scarce knowledge possessed by aging workers.</p><p>The Fujitsu farm work management system supports numerous types of interactions to
                achieve these goals. For example, workers can send pictures of infected crops for
                diagnosis by an expert farmer in the farm’s office, who can then investigate further
                by studying recorded video from the affected plot.</p><p>As more farms deploy the Fujitsu system, the aggregated knowledge and sensor
                information can be analyzed to enable economies of scale that will allow separate
                and widely distributed farms to function as if they were all part of a single large
                firm with centralized management.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-32" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-32" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">574</a>]</sup></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>HOW MUCH ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The current
                design of the system treats farm workers as relatively passive resources that are
                managed very closely. The system generates a daily schedule of planting,
                maintenance, harvesting, and other activities for each worker. At a daily wrap-up
                meeting the farm manager reviews each worker’s performance based on
                    <abbr class="abbrev">GPS</abbr> and sensor readings.</p><p>The sensor data is analyzed and organized extensively by Fujitsu computers to make
                recommendations, both agricultural ones (such as what crop grows best in each plot
                and the work schedule that optimizes quality and yield), and business ones (what is
                the profitability of growing this crop on this plot of land).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHEN ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The farm work
                management system is continually organizing and reorganizing what it knows about the
                farm as it analyzes sensor and production information. In contrast, the information
                created by the workers is captured but its analysis is deferred to an expert.</p><p><a id="id674040" class="indexterm"/>It is conceivable that as the farm workers become more expert as a
                result of the guidance and instruction they receive from the system that they can be
                more autonomous and do more analysis and interpretation on their own. It is also
                likely that the inexorable forces of Moore’s Law will enable more data collection
                and more processing of the sensor data at its time of collection, which might result
                in increased real-time information exchange with the workers.</p><p><a id="id674056" class="indexterm"/><span class="bold"><strong>WHO DOES THE ORGANIZING?</strong></span> The physical
                organization of the farm, with 300 small plots of land with 60 different fruits and
                vegetables is the legacy arrangement of the farm before the Fujitsu trial began.
                Because of the sizable investment that Fujitsu has made in the farm to deploy the
                system, it is likely that the farm manager defers to recommendations made by the
                system to change crop arrangements. So it is reasonable to conclude that most of the
                decisions about the organizing system are made by computational processes rather
                than by people.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.</strong></span> Fujitsu built this system
                for managing farms, but there are several other resource domains with similar
                challenges about capturing and reusing operational knowledge: vineyards, forests,
                and fish farms come to mind.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-33" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-33" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">575</a>]</sup> It will be interesting to see if the farm work management system can be
                made more abstract and configurable so that the same system can be used in all of
                these domains.</p><p>Farm crops, vineyards, trees, and fish pens don’t move around, so a more
                challenging application of sensor technologies arises with cattle herd management.
                Nevertheless, sensors inserted in the genitals of a female dairy cow can trigger a
                text message to a herd manager’s cell phone when the cow is in heat, preventing the
                economic loss of missing a reproductive cycle.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-34" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-34" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">576</a>]</sup></p><p>Somewhat more remote domains for potential application of systems that combine
                sensor networks with workforce management include sales, field support, and

                – a self-referential one. It is a case study about the organizing system involved in
                the creation, production, and distribution of <em class="citetitle">The Discipline of
                    Organizing</em>.</p><p>We have known since the beginning of this project that this book should not just
                be a conventional text. A printed book is an intellectual snapshot that is already
                dated in many respects the day it is published. In addition, the pedagogical goal of
                    <em class="citetitle">TDO</em> as a textbook for information schools and similar
                programs is made more difficult by the relentless growth of computing capability and
                the resulting technology innovation in our information-intensive economy and
                culture. We think that the emergence of ebook publishing opens up innovative
                possibilities as long as we can use a single set of source files to produce and
                update the print and digital versions of this book.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The content
                of this book began in early 2010 as more than 1000 slides and associated instructor
                notes for a graduate course on “Information Organizing and Retrieval” that Robert J.
                Glushko, the primary author and editor of <em class="citetitle">TDO</em>, was teaching
                at the University of California at Berkeley. These slides and notes were created in
                XML and transformed to HTML for presentation in a web browser.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-35" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-35" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">577</a>]</sup></p><p>The first decision to be made about resource organization led to the iterative
                sorting of the slides from 26 lectures into the 10 chapters in the initial outline
                for the book. The second decision concerned the granularity of the new content
                resources being created for the book. The team of authors was organized by chapters,
                which made chapters the natural granularity for file management and version control.
                Because authors were widely dispersed we relied on the Dropbox cloud storage service
                to synchronize work. Nevertheless, the broad and deep topical coverage of the book
                meant that chapters had substantial internal structure (four levels of headings in
                some places), and many of these subsections became separately identified resources
                that moved from chapter to chapter until they found their natural home.</p><p>In addition to the text content and illustrations that make up the printed text,
                we needed to organize short videos, interactive examples, and other applications to
                incorporate in digital versions of the book.</p><p>Finally, it has been essential to view the software that transforms, assembles,
                formats, and assigns styles when turning source files into deliverable artifacts as
                resources that must be managed. We have been fortunate to get much of the required
                software from O’Reilly and Associates, an innovative technology publisher that has
                been developing an XML-based single-source publishing system called Atlas.</p><p><a id="id674374" class="indexterm"/><span class="bold"><strong>WHY ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> Publishing print
                and ebook versions of a text from the same source files is the only way to produce
                both in a cost-effective and maintainable fashion. Approaches that require any
                “hand-crafting” would make it impossible to revise the book on a timely schedule.
                Furthermore, a survey of Berkeley students in the summer of 2012 revealed a great
                diversity of preferred platforms for reading digital books that included laptop
                computers, Apple and Android tablets, and seven different dedicated ebook readers.
                Only an automated single-source publishing strategy could produce all these outputs.</p><p>The highly granular structure for the content resources that comprise this book
                makes cross-referencing vastly more precise, making it easier to use the book as a
                textbook and job aid. It will also make it easier to maintain and adapt the text for
                use in online courses. (The emerging best practice for online courses is to break up
                lectures and study content into smaller units than used in traditional classroom
                lectures.) </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>HOW MUCH ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span> The nature
                and extent of resource organization for this book reflects its purpose of bringing
                together multiple disciplines that recognize organizing as a fundamental issue but
                from different perspectives. The book contains many specialized topics and
                domain-specific examples that might overwhelm the shared concepts. Our solution was
                to write a lean core text and to move much of the disciplinary and domain-specific
                content into tagged endnotes. These categories of endnotes are somewhat arbitrary,
                but the authoring task of identifying content to go into endnotes is a non-trivial
                one.</p><p>The extent of resource organization is also affected by the choice of XML
                vocabulary, and we carefully considered whether to choose DITA or DocBook. DITA has
                the benefit of having more native support for modular authoring and transparent
                customization and updating, but DocBook is much older and hence has better tool
                kits. We eventually chose DocBook.<sup>[<a id="chapter-10-endnote-36" href="#ftn.chapter-10-endnote-36" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote">578</a>]</sup></p><p><a id="id674408" class="indexterm"/><span class="bold"><strong>WHEN ARE THE RESOURCES ORGANIZED?</strong></span>
                Despite the fact that the lecture notes with which the book began were in XML, we
                decided to author the book using Microsoft Word. Many of the authors had little
                experience with XML editors, and the highly-developed commenting and revision
                management facilities in Word proved very useful. This tradeoff imposed the burden
                of converting files to XML during the production process but only two of the authors
                were still working on the book at that stage, and both have decades of experience
                with XML.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>WHO DOES THE ORGANIZING?</strong></span> The chapter authors used
                Word style sheets in a careful manner, tagging text with styles rather than using
                formatting overrides. This enabled a conversion vendor to convert most of the book
                from Word to XML semi-automatically. Some cleanup of the markup is inevitable
                because of the ambiguity created when the source markup with Word styles is less
                granular than the target markup in XML. We do not know whether the amount of work
                left for us was atypical.</p><p>Nevertheless, waiting until the book was substantially finished to convert to XML
                meant that we were also deferring the effort to mark up the text with cross
                references, glossary terms, and index entries, because these types of content were
                not included in the Word authoring templates and style sheets. As a result, a
                substantial amount of effort has been required of our copy and markup editor that
                could have been done by chapter editors if they had authored natively in XML.
                However, having a single markup editor has given this book a more consistent and
                complete glossary and index than would be have possible with multiple
                authors.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.</strong></span> Our ambitious effort to use
                tagged endnotes to create a book that could meet the needs of different courses and
                academic programs is a bit ahead of its time, because the current generation of
                ebook readers cannot do it justice. We are working on a next-generation ebook
                application that can create a vastly more engaging and integrated reader experience
                with the tagged endnotes. Instead of requiring the reader to follow a hypertext
                link, our ebook application will present selectable icons that dynamically
                transclude the endnote text into the core text. Furthermore, we are making the set
                of endnote types completely extensible. In addition to the six types that occur in
                the book as first published, any instructor or institution will be able to can
                create other endnote types to meet new requirements for customization.</p><p>This design for a book challenges conventional definitions of book editions and
                forces us to imagine new ways to acknowledge collaborative authorship. But asking
                “What is <em class="citetitle">The Discipline of Organizing</em> given these new
                authoring and publishing models is a similar question to the one asked in

                    <em class="citetitle">The Discipline Of Organizing</em>. We hope that we have
                demonstrated why thinking of the art and science of organizing in a more abstract
                way can enable communication and cooperation across the numerous disciplines that
                are concerned with organizing, especially library and information science, computer
                science, informatics, law, economics, and business. Instead of just appropriating
                concepts and methods from these fields, we have tried to unify them, filling in the
                gaps between their complementary perspectives to yield a more comprehensive and
                generative understanding of how they fit together.</p><p>Now it is your turn. Perhaps you have a job in one of the fields we have brought
                together that involves organizing resources of one type or another. After reading
                this book, you surely won’t approach that work the same way you did before. You will
                be able to apply the design patterns and principles of <em class="citetitle">The Discipline of

                and will be able to create entirely new ones that fill the white space between the
